****Introduction 介绍****
-----------------------

Taking notes on physical non-fiction books is best done by hand. While there's evidence to support we remember handwritten notes best, that's not why we recommend it[1].  
在物理非小说类书籍上做笔记最好是手工完成。虽然有证据支持我们最好记住手写笔记，但这不是我们推荐它的原因 [1] 。

First, sitting at a computer desk while reading is uncomfortable. Second, computers offer us thousands of functions, including thousands of temptations and disruptions. Paper is the opposite. It nudges you to focus and think deeper when reading, as there's nowhere else to spread your attention.  
首先，坐在电脑桌前看书不舒服。其次，计算机为我们提供了数以千计的功能，包括数以千计的诱惑和干扰。纸张则相反。它会促使您在阅读时集中注意力并深入思考，因为没有其他地方可以分散您的注意力。

Before that, it's worth checking that the note-taking technique aligns with your goals. Being the knife in our knife and fork note-taking toolkit, the HQ&A technique is for when narrow depth is a priority. That is, you're reading something that is honestly worth distilling and understanding on a deeper level for the sake of your studies, work, or intellectual curiosity.  
在此之前，值得检查记笔记的技巧是否符合您的目标。作为我们刀叉笔记工具包中的刀，HQ&A 技术适用于优先考虑窄深度的情况。也就是说，为了您的学习、工作或求知欲，您正在阅读一些真正值得提炼和更深层次理解的东西。

If you need something faster, as you're just learning a topic, or because slowing down to take thoughtful notes isn't preferable or practical, then our [Jump Notes technique](https://words.jamoe.org/jump-notes/) will be a better fit.  
如果你需要更快的东西，因为你只是在学习一个主题，或者因为放慢速度做深思熟虑的笔记是不可取或不切实际的，那么我们的跳跃笔记技术将更适合。

We'll provide an abridged recap of the HQ&A note-taking technique below, but if you'd like a full refresher, please see the debut article on the topic: [HQ&A: Take Better Notes When Reading Non-Fiction](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/highlight-question-and-answer).  
我们将在下面提供 HQ&A 笔记技术的简要回顾，但如果您想全面复习，请参阅有关该主题的首篇文章：HQ&A：阅读非小说时做更好的笔记。

For illustration purposes, we'll be featuring the notes we took while reading Bill Gates' 2021 book, [_How to Avoid a Climate Disaster_](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/0241448301/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?creative=6738&creativeASIN=0241448301&ie=UTF8&linkCode=as2&linkId=bf35499792bf7f887522d2468d7659ba&tag=anoddedu-21).  
出于说明目的，我们将重点介绍我们在阅读比尔盖茨 2021 年出版的书《如何避免气候灾难》时所做的笔记。

****What does the result look like?  
结果是什么样的？****
--------------------------------------------------

Let's start with the result and work backwards. Below you'll see a sample of the handwritten notes we took while reading Gates' book on avoiding climate disaster.  
让我们从结果开始并向后工作。下面您将看到我们在阅读盖茨关于避免气候灾难的书时所做的手写笔记样本。

![](https://words.jamoe.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Images-04.jpg)On the left are our handwritten notes. The right shows an abstraction of what we've written so that you can see the high-level structure of our HQ&A Notes.  
左边是我们的手写笔记。右边显示了我们所写内容的抽象，以便您可以看到我们的 HQ&A 说明的高级结构。

Focus your attention on the right. The graphic shows the high-level structure of our notes. Before we offer more context, one of the key benefits of this approach is clear: reviewing your notes in this format is as quick as a hungry caterpillar through lettuce.  
将注意力集中在右边。该图显示了我们笔记的高级结构。在我们提供更多背景信息之前，这种方法的主要好处之一是显而易见的：以这种格式复习笔记就像饥饿的毛毛虫吃生菜一样快。

Each note is a distinct building block representing the ideas and insights that resonated with us. When reviewing our notes, either to write something based on its argument or to recall the insights, all of the most significant points are waiting for us. That makes the review process much faster, as we can easily skim the questions and dive into the details as needed.  
每个笔记都是一个独特的组成部分，代表了与我们产生共鸣的想法和见解。在回顾我们的笔记时，无论是根据其论点写点什么，还是回忆其中的见解，所有最重要的要点都在等待着我们。这使得审查过程更快，因为我们可以轻松地浏览问题并根据需要深入了解细节。

Take this example. Say we're going through our notes, and we want to know the best way to prioritise which carbon reduction technologies we should be investing in. Glancing over our questions, we can quickly find a note that fits:  
举个例子。假设我们正在浏览我们的笔记，我们想知道最好的方法来确定我们应该投资哪些碳减排技术的优先顺序。浏览我们的问题，我们可以快速找到适合的笔记：

**Question:** Why is measuring carbon reduction in 'equivalent to taking one car off the road' unhelpful? What's a better approach?  
问题：为什么用 “相当于将一辆汽车从路上开走” 来衡量碳减排量没有帮助？什么是更好的方法？

Questions are shorter than summaries. That makes finding a relevant note much faster. The added benefit is that the Question prompts you to recall and remember the insights from the text. That helps fight forgetfulness per the [Spaced Repetition Technique](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/spaced-repetition).  
问题比摘要短。这样可以更快地找到相关注释。额外的好处是问题会提示您回忆并记住文本中的见解。根据间隔重复技术，这有助于对抗健忘。

When we've found a Question that's a strong fit, we'll read our Answer. If we need more context, we'll also read the original Highlight we took from the text:  
当我们找到一个非常合适的问题时，我们将阅读我们的答案。如果我们需要更多上下文，我们还将阅读我们从文本中提取的原始亮点：

**Answer:** Because who knows how many cars are on the road? Better to judge every carbon reducing initiative as a % of carbon emissions, which is 51 billion tons. So, if a technology is projected to cut 500 million tons that's ~1% of global emissions.  
答：因为谁知道路上有多少辆车？最好将每项碳减排举措判断为碳排放量的百分比，即 510 亿吨。因此，如果一项技术预计可减少 5 亿吨，那将占全球排放量的 1%。

**Highlight:** '...Connect everything back to the main goal of eliminating 51 billion tons of year. Consider the emissions-trading program in Europe that reduced the carbon footprint of the aviation section by 17 million tons per year... Divide it by 51 billion... that's a reduction of 0.03% of annual global emissions.' p.53  
亮点：'...... 把一切都联系起来，回到年淘汰 510 亿吨的主要目标。考虑一下欧洲的排放交易计划，该计划每年将航空部门的碳足迹减少 1700 万吨…… 除以 510 亿…… 这相当于全球年排放量的 0.03%。第 53 页

With this approach, your note-taking technique is working for you rather than against you.  
通过这种方法，您的记笔记技巧对您有利而不是不利。

Its design allows you to jump between moving fast and slow through your notes and has the benefits of active recall built-in, making your memories stickier.  
它的设计让您可以在笔记中快速和缓慢地移动，并且具有内置的主动回忆的好处，让您的记忆更加牢固。

****Workflow for taking handwritten HQ&A** N**otes  
手写 HQ&A 笔记的工作流程****
------------------------------------------------------------------------

With a clear view of what you'll end up with and how it's designed to make review and recall efficient, let's unpack the workflow for taking a handwritten HQ&A note.  
清楚地了解您最终会得到什么以及它是如何设计来提高审查和回忆效率的，让我们解开手写 HQ&A 笔记的工作流程。

Equipment-wise, you don't need anything fancier than a pen and some paper:  
在设备方面，您不需要比笔和纸更高级的东西：

1.  ****Divide your paper into two columns:**** we do this without a ruler. Instead, we just hold our paper in portrait and fold it in half. Columns are more skimmable, making reviewing your notes later easier. The narrow width will also make you more precise with your word choice. Precise word choice is precise thinking.  
    将您的论文分为两栏：我们在没有尺子的情况下这样做。相反，我们只是纵向拿着我们的纸并将其对折。列更易于浏览，使以后更容易查看您的笔记。较窄的宽度也会使您的单词选择更加精确。精确的选词就是精确的思考。
2.  ****Write your Question first:**** when reading, an insight might catch your attention. Your Highlight is the part of the text that best captures that insight or is a quote you want to reference later. However, think of a precise Question for which the Highlight is the answer. That will force you to apply the new idea, and it is the difference between knowledge and understanding. Thinking of an effective connecting Question is a mental workout, so it may take some time, but that's a sign you're digesting what you're reading.  
    首先写下您的问题：阅读时，一个见解可能会引起您的注意。你的亮点是文本中最能捕捉到这种洞察力的部分，或者是你想稍后参考的引述。但是，请考虑一个精确的问题，突出显示是其答案。那会迫使你应用新的想法，这就是知识和理解之间的区别。想出一个有效的连接问题是一种心理锻炼，因此可能需要一些时间，但这表明您正在消化所阅读的内容。
3.  ****Write your Answer:**** write, in your own words, the answer to your Question. This should be a crisp summary future-you will appreciate it when you come to review and recall your notes.  
    写下你的答案：用你自己的话写下你的问题的答案。这应该是一个清晰的总结未来——当你来回顾和回忆你的笔记时，你会很感激。
4.  ****Write your Highlight:**** write down the excerpt from the text and the page number. By writing this last, it'll put your insights at the top of every note and the additional context at the bottom. That makes reviewing your notes faster per the above example.  
    写下你的亮点：写下文本和页码的摘录。通过最后写这个，它会将您的见解放在每个笔记的顶部，并将额外的上下文放在底部。根据上面的示例，这可以更快地查看您的笔记。

As you repeat this process, you'll end up with bitesize blocks of the best ideas and insights from the text. That's why the HQ&A technique is the knife in our knife and fork note-taking toolkit: with it, you can carve up even the toughest concepts in what you're reading.  
当你重复这个过程时，你最终会得到文本中最好的想法和见解的一小块。这就是为什么 HQ&A 技术是我们刀叉式笔记工具包中的一把刀：有了它，您甚至可以在阅读的内容中分割出最难的概念。

The bonus is that every note represents your own thoughts on the author's ideas, and you'll be able to steer clear of the pitfall of copying rather than comprehending what the author is saying.  
好处是每个笔记都代表了你对作者想法的看法，你将能够避免抄袭而不是理解作者在说什么的陷阱。

![](https://words.jamoe.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Images-03.jpg)A note taken on the hidden and unaccounted for carbon-cost of construction. Materials like cement, glass, plastic, and steel are cheap because their price doesn’t include the cost of the carbon they produce[2]. The challenge is to find a way to allow everyone to build thriving communities while removing carbon from the equation. The book goes on to show how.  
关于隐蔽和未计算的建筑碳成本的记录。水泥、玻璃、塑料和钢铁等材料很便宜，因为它们的价格不包括它们生产的碳的成本 [2] 。挑战在于找到一种方法，让每个人都能建立繁荣的社区，同时从等式中去除碳。这本书继续展示如何。

****Balancing joy and effort when taking notes  
记笔记时平衡快乐和努力****
----------------------------------------------------------------

Taking notes when reading can ruin your flow. Sometimes you just want to get through a text or be carried away by the author's lyrical prose. That's part of the joy of reading.  
阅读时做笔记会破坏你的流程。有时你只想通读一段文字，或者被作者的抒情散文所吸引。这是阅读乐趣的一部分。

However, you're also reading to squeeze out some of the book's goodness and store it for the future. That's the effort of note-taking, and it'll help you become a deeper and more original thinker over the long run.  
然而，你读书也是为了榨取这本书的一些优点，并为将来储存起来。这就是做笔记的功劳，从长远来看，它会帮助你成为一个更深刻、更有独创性的思考者。

This balance between joy and effort means finding your place between these two extremes:  
快乐和努力之间的这种平衡意味着在这两个极端之间找到你的位置：

*   **(Joy) T**he best stuff will stick**** – take notes on nothing.  
    （喜悦）最好的东西会留下来——什么都不做笔记。
*   **(Effort) F**orget nothing**** – take notes on everything.  
    （用力）什么都不忘——记下一切。

Depending on how comfortable you are with the material you're reading and how much time you have, the HQ&A technique may be too effortful. If that's the case, we recommend switching over to our more joyful thinking fast note-taking technique: [Jump Notes](https://words.jamoe.org/jump-notes/).  
根据您对正在阅读的材料的适应程度以及您有多少时间，HQ&A 技术可能过于费力。如果是这种情况，我们建议切换到我们更快乐的思维快速记笔记技术：跳跃笔记。

If the HQ&A technique is the right fit for your needs and you're comfortable using it, there are a couple of tweaks you can make to strike a more sustainable balance between joy and effort. The first is practical; the second is philosophical.  
如果 HQ&A 技术非常适合您的需求，并且您使用起来很舒服，那么您可以进行一些调整，以在快乐和努力之间取得更可持续的平衡。第一个是实用的；第二个是哲学的。

### **Don't write out the H**ighlight 不要写出亮点****

Copying out the Highlight is time-consuming. That's why we run a mental check beforehand to see if it's worth it. If both conditions are true, then we recommend skipping this step:  
复制突出显示非常耗时。这就是为什么我们事先进行心理检查，看看它是否值得。如果两个条件都成立，那么我们建议跳过此步骤：

1.  When it feels more like a chore than something that adds value.  
    当感觉更像是一件苦差事而不是增加价值的东西时。
2.  When skipping the Highlight doesn't cut out any important context, we'll need to make the note useful later, e.g. a statistic we want to reference.  
    当跳过突出显示不会删除任何重要的上下文时，我们需要使注释在以后有用，例如我们要参考的统计数据。

Other times when you'll not want to skip the Highlight include when you want to capture phrasing that is particularly novel or beautiful[3]. Another is if you're borrowing the book from a library or a friend. You won't be able to easily return to the original text, so writing down the Highlight will serve as your own small copy of the author's brain.  
其他时候您不想跳过亮点包括当您想要捕捉特别新颖或美丽的措辞时 [3] 。另一种情况是，如果您是从图书馆或朋友那里借书。你将无法轻易回到原文，所以写下 Highlight 将作为你自己的作者大脑的小副本。

### ****Honest Productivity Principles when note-taking  
做笔记时的诚实生产力原则****

As written about in the debut [HQ&A article](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/highlight-question-and-answer), our Honest Productivity Principles also serve as a valuable compass for prioritising quality over quantity:  
正如在首篇 HQ&A 文章中所写，我们的诚实生产力原则也可以作为一个有价值的指南针，用于优先考虑质量而不是数量：

*   **Focus on what matters:** simple to the point of almost being insulting, but don't take notes on everything you consume. Instead, have a strong filter for prioritising. Our filter is that whatever we're consuming must help us move forward with some goal that matters.  
    专注于重要的事情：简单到几乎被侮辱的地步，但不要记录你消费的一切。相反，有一个强大的过滤器来确定优先级。我们的过滤器是，无论我们消费什么，都必须帮助我们朝着重要的目标前进。
*   **Achieve more with less:** when reading, look for the note that captures 80% of the value but is only 20% of the effort. Often non-fiction is repetitive, padded, or gives examples to ensure you get it. But, once you've got it, you can compress the idea, so it occupies a much smaller space.  
    事半功倍：阅读时，寻找能抓住 80% 的价值但只付出 20% 努力的笔记。非小说类作品通常是重复的、填充的或提供示例以确保您能够理解。但是，一旦你有了它，你就可以压缩这个想法，所以它占据的空间要小得多。
*   **Work sustainably:** if you haven't taken a note for a while, check to see you're still concentrating. Usually, this happens when we're tired, so we'll take a break, as carrying on will only give us the illusion of progress.  
    可持续地工作：如果您有一段时间没有做笔记，请检查您是否仍在集中注意力。通常，这发生在我们累了的时候，所以我们会休息一下，因为继续前进只会给我们带来进步的错觉。

****The Post-It Note Variation 便利贴的变体****
-----------------------------------------

This is our personal sweet spot between joy and effort when using the HQ&A technique. We've left this for last, as you don't need to use Post-It Notes to get value from the HQ&A technique, but you may want to consider using them at some point.  
这是我们个人在使用 HQ&A 技术时在快乐和努力之间的最佳平衡点。我们把它留到最后，因为您不需要使用便利贴来从 HQ&A 技术中获取价值，但您可能希望在某些时候考虑使用它们。

By writing our HQ&A Notes on Post-Its and then placing them on the relevant pages, we end up with a book that's full of shortcuts to the main ideas and insights we care about.  
通过在便利贴上写下我们的 HQ&A 笔记，然后将它们放在相关的页面上，我们最终得到了一本书，其中充满了通往我们关心的主要思想和见解的捷径。

As Post-Its are small, they force us to focus our notes on what's important. Then we need to compose the note thoughtfully to ensure that the compressed idea still makes sense. That includes potentially peppering in a few helpful diagrams.  
由于便利贴很小，它们迫使我们将笔记集中在重要的事情上。然后我们需要深思熟虑地撰写笔记，以确保压缩的想法仍然有意义。这包括可能加入一些有用的图表。

![](https://words.jamoe.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Images-02.jpg)An example of a Post-It HQ&A note from _The Silk Roads_. We always include the time period for historical notes, as it serves as an anchor for the memory, allowing us to place it amongst other historical events.  
来自丝绸之路的 Post-It HQ&A 便条示例。我们总是包括历史笔记的时间段，因为它可以作为记忆的锚点，使我们能够将它放在其他历史事件中。

If we ever need to re-read the original context, we can look under the Post-It by lifting it off the page. That spares us copying out the Highlight. Wanting to avoid tearing any pages, we also touch the sticky edge of the Post-It on our jeans before placing it down to dampen the stickiness.  
如果我们需要重新阅读原始上下文，我们可以通过将便利贴从页面上取下来查看它。这让我们省去了抄袭亮点。为避免撕破任何页面，我们还在牛仔裤上贴上便利贴的粘性边缘，然后再将其放下以抑制粘性。

![](https://words.jamoe.org/content/images/size/w600/2021/06/Images-01.jpg)A summary of how to make Post-It HQ&A notes.  
如何制作 Post-It HQ&A 笔记的摘要。

Tweaking our handwritten notes workflow in this way has transformed our bookshelves, as our notes and our books now live together. This feeds two birds with one scone, as visiting one means visiting the other.  
以这种方式调整我们的手写笔记工作流程已经改变了我们的书架，因为我们的笔记和我们的书现在在一起。这可以用一个烤饼喂养两只鸟，因为拜访一只鸟就意味着拜访另一只鸟。

****Conclusion 结论****
---------------------

When reading physical non-fiction books in this way, you may want to type up your notes. In the interest of balancing time and value, we recommend prioritising your notes and only typing up the ones you want to remix and retain in a digital form.  
以这种方式阅读实体非小说类书籍时，您可能需要输入笔记。为了平衡时间和价值，我们建议优先考虑您的笔记，只输入您想要重新混合并以数字形式保留的笔记。

When prioritising, we ask ourselves, 'Will this note be useful?'. For example, if the notes we've taken on a book will form part of our [Spaced Repetition](https://words.jamoe.org/spaced-repetition/) workflow for something we're learning, then we'll type that up. Or, if we want the note to be searchable because it's a great fertiliser for our writing and connects to ideas we've read elsewhere, we'll type that up too.  
在确定优先次序时，我们会问自己，“这张纸条有用吗？”。例如，如果我们在一本书上做的笔记将构成我们正在学习的东西的间隔重复工作流程的一部分，那么我们将把它打出来。或者，如果我们希望笔记可搜索，因为它是我们写作的重要肥料，并且与我们在其他地方读到的想法有关，我们也会将其输入。

Time is precious, so rather than capturing everything, we only invest it where we think it’ll help achieve our goals. That's part of Honest Productivity.  
时间是宝贵的，所以我们不会抓住一切，只将时间投入到我们认为有助于实现目标的地方。这是诚实生产力的一部分。

### Footnotes 脚注

[1] Looking at the literature, there are many credible studies on the advantages of handwritten notes. However, [this one](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797614524581) published in Psychological Science is the most thought-provoking and instructive. Most studies focus on the distractions of using a computer. This study goes further. It found that even when using a laptop solely for note-taking by eliminating its multi-tasking functions, it still results in an inferior level of understanding and retention compared to those who took their notes by hand: “laptop note takers’ tendency to transcribe lectures verbatim rather than processing information and reframing it in their own words is detrimental to learning”.  
[1] 纵观文献，有很多关于手写笔记优势的可靠研究。不过，发表在 Psychological Science 上的这篇最发人深省和启发。大多数研究都集中在使用计算机的干扰上。这项研究更进一步。研究发现，即使通过取消笔记本电脑的多任务功能，仅使用笔记本电脑做笔记，与手动记笔记的人相比，它的理解和记忆水平仍然较低：“笔记本电脑记录者倾向于转录逐字逐句地讲课，而不是处理信息并用自己的话重新组织，这对学习是不利的”。

The change allowed many women to become wage-earners for the first time. Her phrasing in this poem about the woes of marriage is especially striking, "Don't hurtle into marriage too soon... one who earns her board and clothes shouldn't scurry to suffer a man's rod... Through wedlock I do not decry; unyoked is best! Happy the woman without a man!".
