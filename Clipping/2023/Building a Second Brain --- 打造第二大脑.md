Introduction The Promise of a Second Brain  
简介 第二大脑的前景
-------------------------------------------------------

How often have you tried to remember something important and felt it slip through your mental grasp?  
你有多少次试图记住一些重要的事情, 却感觉它从你的脑海中溜走了?

Perhaps you were having a conversation and couldn’t remember a fact that would have convincingly supported your point of view. Maybe you conceived of a brilliant new idea while driving or in transit, but by the time you arrived at your destination, it had evaporated. How often have you struggled to recall even one useful takeaway from a book or article you read in the past?  
也许您正在交谈, 但不记得可以令人信服地支持您的观点的事实。也许你在开车或途中想到了一个绝妙的新想法, 但当你到达目的地时, 它已经烟消云散了。您是否经常难以回忆起您过去读过的一本书或一篇文章中的一个有用的要点?

As the amount of information we have access to grows, such experiences are becoming more and more common. We’re flooded with more advice than ever promising to make us smarter, healthier, and happier. We consume more books, podcasts, articles, and videos than we could possibly absorb. What do we really have to show for all the knowledge we’ve gained? How many of the great ideas we’ve had or encountered have faded from our minds before we even had a chance to put them into practice?  
随着我们接触到的信息量越来越大, 这种体验也越来越普遍。我们收到了比以往任何时候都多的建议, 它们承诺让我们更聪明、更健康、更快乐。我们消费的书籍、播客、文章和视频比我们可能吸收的要多。对于我们获得的所有知识, 我们真正需要展示什么? 在我们有机会付诸实践之前, 有多少我们曾经拥有或遇到的伟大想法已经从我们的脑海中消失了?

We spend countless hours reading, listening to, and watching other people’s opinions about what we should do, how we should think, and how we should live, but make comparatively little effort applying that knowledge and making it our own. So much of the time we are “information hoarders,” stockpiling endless amounts of well-intentioned content that only ends up increasing our anxiety.  
我们花了无数时间阅读、倾听和观察其他人对我们应该做什么、我们应该如何 思考以及我们应该如何生活的看法, 但相对来说很少努力应用这些知识并将其变成我们自己的。很多时候我们都是 “信息囤积者”, 囤积无穷无尽的善意内容, 最终只会增加我们的焦虑。

This book is dedicated to changing that. You see, all the content you consume online and through all the different kinds of media you have at your disposal isn’t useless. It’s incredibly important and valuable. The only problem is that you’re often consuming it at the wrong time.  
本书致力于改变这种状况。你看, 你在网上和通过你所拥有的各种不同媒体消费的所有内容都不是无用的。这是非常重要和有价值的。唯一的问题是您经常在错误的时间食用它。

What are the chances that the business book you’re reading is exactly what you need right at this moment? What are the odds that every single insight from a podcast interview is immediately actionable? How many of the emails sitting in your inbox actually require your full attention right now? More likely, some of it will be relevant now, but most of it will become relevant only at some point in the future.  
您正在阅读的商业书籍恰好是您此刻所需要的机会有多大? 播客采访中的每一个见解都可以立即付诸行动的可能性有多大? 您收件箱中有多少电子邮件实际上需要您立即全神贯注? 更有可能的是, 其中一些现在是相关的, 但大部分只会在未来的某个时候变得相关。

To be able to make use of information we value, we need a way to package it up and send it through time to our future self. We need a way to cultivate a body of knowledge that is uniquely our own, so when the opportunity arises—whether changing jobs, giving a big presentation, launching a new product, or starting a business or a family—we will have access to the wisdom we need to make good decisions and take the most effective action. It all begins with the simple act of writing things down.  
为了能够利用我们重视的信息, 我们需要一种方法将其打包并通过时间将其发送给我们未来的自己。我我们需要智慧来做出正确的决定并采取最有效的行动。这一切都始于将事情写下来这一简单行为。

I’ll show you how this simple habit is the first step in a system I’ve developed called Building a Second Brain, which draws on recent advancements in the field of PKM—or personal knowledge management.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-046) In the same way that personal computers revolutionized our relationship with technology, personal finance changed how we manage our money, and personal productivity reshaped how we work, personal knowledge management helps us harness the full potential of what we know. While innovations in technology and a new generation of powerful apps have created new opportunities for our times, the lessons you will find within these pages are built on timeless and unchanging principles.  
我将向您展示这个简单的习惯是如何成为我开发的名为 “构建第二大脑” 的系统的第一步, 该系统借鉴了 PKM 或个人知识管理领域的最新进展。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-046) 就像个人电脑彻底改变了我们与技术的 关系, 个人理财改变了我们管理金钱的方式, 个人生产力重塑了我们的工作方式一样, 个人知识管理帮助我们充分发挥我们所知道的潜力。虽然技术创新和新一代强大的应用程序为我们的时代创造了新机遇, 但您在这些页面中找到的课程是建立在永恒不变的原则之上的。

The Building a Second Brain system will teach you how to:  
构建第二大脑系统将教您如何:

*   Find anything you’ve learned, touched, or thought about in the past within seconds.  
    在几秒钟内找到您过去学过、接触过或想过的任何内容。
*   Organize your knowledge and use it to move your projects and goals forward more consistently.  
    组织您的知识并使用它来更一致地推进您的项目和目标。
*   Save your best thinking so you don’t have to do it again.  
    保存您最好的想法, 这样您就不必重蹈覆辙。
*   Connect ideas and notice patterns across different areas of your life so you know how to live better.  
    连接生活中不同领域的想法和注意模式, 这样您就知道如何生活得更好。
*   Adopt a reliable system that helps you share your work more confidently and with more ease.  
    采用可靠的系统, 帮助您更自信、更轻松地分享您的工作。
*   Turn work “off” and relax, knowing you have a trusted system keeping track of all the details.  
    “关闭” 工作并放松, 因为您知道您有一个可信赖的系统来跟踪所有细节。
*   Spend less time looking for things, and more time doing the best, most creative work you are capable of.  
    花更少的时间找东西, 把更多的时间花在做你能做的最好、最有创意的工作上。

When you transform your relationship to information, you will begin to see the technology in your life not just as a storage medium but as a _tool for thinking_. Like a bicycle for the mind,[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-045) once we learn how to use it properly, technology can enhance our cognitive abilities and accelerate us toward our goals far faster than we could ever achieve on our own.  
当您将您的关系转变为信息时, 您将开始将生活中的技术视为一种存储介质, 而不是一种思考工具。就像大脑的自行车一样, [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-045) 一旦我们学会了如何正确使用它, 技术就可以增强我们的认知能力 并加速我们实现目标的速度远远超过我们自己实现的速度。

In this book I will teach you how to create a system of knowledge management, or a “Second Brain.”[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-044) Whether you call it a “personal cloud,” “field notes,” or an “external brain” as some of my students have done, it is a digital archive of your most valuable memories, ideas, and knowledge to help you do your job, run your business, and manage your life without having to keep every detail in your head. Like a personal library in your pocket, a Second Brain enables you to recall everything you might want to remember so you can achieve anything you desire.  
在本书中, 我将教您如何创建知识管理系统或 “第二大脑”。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-044) 无论你称它为 “个人云”、“田野笔记”, 还是像我的一些学生所说的 “外部大脑”, 它都是你最宝贵的记忆、想法和知识的数字档案, 可以帮助你做你的工作, 经营你的生意, 管理你的生活, 而不必把每一个细节都记在脑子里。就像你口袋里的个人图书馆一样, 第二大脑可以让你回忆起你可能想记住的一切, 这样你就可以实现任何你想要的。

I’ve come to believe that personal knowledge management is one of the most fundamental challenges—as well as one of the most incredible opportunities—in the world today. Everyone is in desperate need of a system to manage the ever-increasing volume of information pouring into their brains. I’ve heard the plea from students and executives, entrepreneurs and managers, engineers and writers, and so many others seeking a more productive and empowered relationship with the information they consume.  
我开始相信, 个人知识管理是当今世界最根本的挑战之一, 也是最不可思议的机遇之一。每个人都迫切需要一个系统来管理涌入他们大脑的不断增加的信息量。我听到了学生和高管、企业家和经理、工程师和作家以及许多其他人的请求, 他们寻求与他们消费的信息建立更有成效和更有权力的关系。

Those who learn how to leverage technology and master the flow of information through their lives will be empowered to accomplish anything they set their minds to. At the same time, those who continue to rely on their fragile biological brains will become ever more overwhelmed by the explosive growth in the complexity of our lives.  
那些学习如何利用技术并掌握生活中信息流的人将有能力完成他们下定决心要做的任何事情。与此同时, 那些继续依赖他们脆弱的生物大脑的人将越来越被我们生活复杂性的爆炸性增长所淹没。

I’ve spent years studying how prolific writers, artists, and thinkers of the past managed their creative process. I’ve spent countless hours researching how human beings can use technology to extend and enhance our natural cognitive abilities. I’ve personally experimented with every tool, trick, and technique available today for making sense of information. This book distills the very best insights I’ve discovered from teaching thousands of people around the world how to realize the potential of their ideas.  
我花了多年时间研究过去多产的作家、艺术家和思想家是如何管理他们的创作过程的。我花了无数时间 研究人类如何使用技术来扩展和增强我们的自然认知能力。我亲自试验了当今可用的每一种工具、技巧和技术来理解信息。这本书提炼了我从教世界各地成千上万的人如何实现他们的想法的潜力中发现的最好的见解。

With a Second Brain at your fingertips, you will be able to unlock the full potential of your hidden strengths and creative instincts. You will have a system that supports you when you are forgetful and unleashes you when you are strong. You will be able to do and learn and create so much more, with so much less effort and stress, than was ever possible before.  
借助触手可及的第二大脑, 您将能够释放隐藏的优势和创造本能的全部潜力。您将拥有一个系统, 在您健忘时支持您, 在您坚强时释放您。你将能够以比以往任何时候都少得多的努力和压力, 做更多、学习更多、创造更多。

In the next chapter, I’ll tell you the story of how I built my own Second Brain, and the lessons I learned along the way about how you can build one for yourself.  
在下一章中, 我将告诉你我如何构建自己的第二大脑的故事, 以及我在构建自己第二大脑的过程中学到的经验教训。

The field of PKM emerged in the 1990s to help university students handle the huge volume of information they suddenly had access to through Internet-connected libraries. It is the individual counterpart to Knowledge Management, which studies how companies and other organizations make use of their knowledge.

> Your mind is for having ideas, not holding them.  
> 你的头脑是为了有想法, 而不是持有它们。
> 
> —David Allen, author of _Getting Things Done_  
> ——大卫 · 艾伦,《把事情做好》的作者

One spring day during my junior year of college, for no apparent reason, I began to feel a small pain in the back of my throat.  
大学三年级的一个春天, 不知为何, 我开始感到喉咙后部有点痛。

I thought it was the first sign of a flu coming on, but my doctor couldn’t find a trace of illness. It slowly got worse over the next few months, and I began to visit other, more specialized doctors. They all arrived at the same conclusion: there’s nothing wrong with you.  
我以为这是流感的第一个征兆, 但我的医生找不到任何病症。在接下来的几个月里, 情况慢慢变得更糟, 我开始去看其他更专业的医生。他们都得出了同一个结论: 你没有任何问题。

Yet my pain continued getting worse and worse, with no remedy in sight. Eventually it became so severe that I had trouble speaking or swallowing or laughing. I did every diagnostic test and scan imaginable, desperately looking for answers for why I was feeling this way.  
然而我的疼痛却越来越严重, 看不到任何补救措施。最终它变得如此严重, 以至于我无法说话、吞咽或大笑。我做了所有可以想象到的诊断测试和扫描, 拼命寻找我为什么会有这种感觉的答案。

As months and then years passed, I began to lose hope that I would ever find relief. I started taking a powerful anti-seizure medication that temporarily relieved the pain, but there were terrible side effects, including a numbing sensation throughout my body and severe short-term memory loss. Entire trips I took, books I read, and precious experiences with loved ones during this period were wiped from my memory as if they never happened. I was a twenty-four-year-old with the mind of an eighty-year-old.  
几个月、几年过去了, 我开始对自己能找到解脱失去希望。我开始服用一种强效的抗癫痫药, 可以暂时缓解疼痛, 但副作用很严重, 包括全身麻木和严重的短期记忆丧失。这段时间里我所有的旅行、阅读的书籍以及与所爱之人的宝贵经历都从我的记忆中抹去, 就好像它们从未发生过一样。我是一个二十四岁的人, 有着八十岁的头脑。

As my ability to express myself continued to deteriorate, my discouragement turned to despair. Without the ability to speak freely, so much of what life had to offer—friendships, dating, traveling, and finding a career I was passionate about—seemed like it was slipping away from me. It felt like a dark curtain was being drawn over the stage of my life before I even had a chance to start my performance.  
随着我的表达能力不断退化, 我的气馁变成了绝望。由于无法畅所欲言, 生活中的很多东西——友谊、约会、旅行和寻找我热爱的事业——似乎都在从我身边溜走。在我还没来得及开始表演之前, 我的人生舞台就好像被拉上了一道黑幕。

### A Personal Turning Point—Discovering the Power of Writing Things Down  
个人转折点——发现把事情写下来的力量

One day, sitting in yet another doctor’s office waiting for yet another visit, I had an epiphany. I realized in a flash that I was at a crossroads. I could either take responsibility for my own health and my own treatment from that day forward, or I would spend the rest of my life shuttling back and forth between doctors without ever finding resolution.  
有一天, 我坐在另一位医生的办公室里等待再次就诊, 顿悟了。我瞬间意识到我正处在一个十字路口。从那天起, 我要么为自己的健康和治疗负责, 要么我将度过余生, 在医生之间来回穿梭, 永远找不到解决办法。

I took out my journal and began to write what I was feeling and thinking. I wrote out the history of my condition, through my own lens and in my own words, for the first time. I listed which treatments had helped and which hadn’t. I wrote down what I wanted and didn’t want, what I was willing to sacrifice and what I wasn’t, and what it would mean to me to escape the world of pain I felt trapped within.  
我拿出日记本, 开始写下我的感受和想法。我第一次通过自己的镜头和自己的话写下了我的病史。我列出了哪些治疗有帮助, 哪些没有。我写下了我想要和不想要的东西, 我愿意牺牲的东西和我不愿意牺牲的东西, 以及逃离我感到被困在其中的痛苦世界对我来说意味着什么。

As the story of my health began to take shape on the page, I knew what I needed to do. I stood up abruptly, walked over to the receptionist, and asked for my complete patient record. She looked at me quizzically, but after I answered a few questions, she turned to her files and began making photocopies.  
当我的健康故事开始在纸上成形时, 我知道我需要做什么。我猛地站起来, 走到接待员面前, 要了我完整的病历。她疑惑地看着我, 但在我回答了几个问题后, 她转向她的文件并开始复印。

My patient record amounted to hundreds of pages, and I knew I would never be able to keep track of them on paper. I started scanning every page on my family’s home computer, turning them into digital records that could be searched, rearranged, annotated, and shared. I became the project manager of my own condition, taking detailed notes on everything my doctors told me, trying out every suggestion they made, and generating questions to review during my next appointment.  
我的病历有数百页, 我知道我永远无法在纸上记录下来。我开始扫描家里电脑上的每一页, 将它们变成可以搜索、重新排列、注释和共享的数字记录。我 成为我自己病情的项目经理, 详细记录医生告诉我的一切, 尝试他们提出的每一个建议, 并提出问题以在我下次预约时进行审查。

With all this information in one place, patterns began to emerge. With my doctors’ help, I discovered a class of afflictions called “functional voice disorders,” which included problems with any of the more than fifty pairs of muscles required to properly swallow a piece of food. I realized that the medications I was taking were masking my symptoms, and in the process making it harder to hear what they were telling me. What I had was not an illness or infection that could be eradicated with a pill—it was a functional condition that required changes in how I took care of my body.  
将所有这些信息集中在一个地方, 模式开始出现。在医生的帮助下, 我发现了一类称为 “功能性声音障碍” 的病痛, 其中包括正确吞咽一块食物所需的 50 多对肌肉中的任何一块出现问题。我意识到我正在服用的药物掩盖了我的症状, 并在此过程中让我更难听到他们告诉我的事情。我所患的不是一种可以用药片根除的疾病或感染——它是一种功能性状况, 需要我改变照顾自己身体的方式。

I began to research how breathing, nutrition, vocal habits, and even past experiences in childhood can be manifested in the nervous system. I started to understand the mind-body connection and how my thoughts and feelings directly impacted the way my body felt. Taking notes on everything I learned, I devised an experiment: I would try a few simple lifestyle changes, such as improving my diet and regular meditation, combined with a series of voice exercises I learned from a voice therapist. To my shock and amazement, it began to work almost immediately. My pain didn’t disappear, but it became far more manageable.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-043)  
我开始研究呼吸、营养、发声习惯, 甚至童年时期的过去经历如何在神经系统中表现出来。我开始理解身心的联系, 以及我的想法和感受如何直接影响我的身体感觉。记下我学到的一切, 我设计了一个实验: 我会尝试一些简单的生活方式改变, 比如改善我的饮食和定期冥想, 结合我从声音治疗师那里学到的一系列声音练习。令我震惊和惊讶的是, 它几乎立即开始工作。我的痛苦并没有消失, 但它变得更容易控制了。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-043)

As I look back, my notes were as important in finding relief as any medicine or procedure. They gave me the chance to step back from the details of my condition and see my situation from a different perspective. For both the outer world of medicine and the inner world of sensations, my notes were a practical medium for turning any new information I encountered into practical solutions I could use.  
当我回顾过去时, 我的笔记对于寻找解脱与任何药物或程序一样重要。他们让我有机会从我的病情细节中退一步, 从不同的角度看待我的处境。对于医学的外部世界和感觉的内部世界, 我的笔记都是一种实用的媒介, 可以将我遇到的任何新信息转化为我可以使用的实用解决方案。

From then on, I became obsessed with the potential of technology to channel the information all around me. I began to realize that the simple act of taking notes on a computer was the tip of an iceberg. Because once made digital, notes were no longer limited to short, handwritten scribbles—they could take any form, including images, links, and files of any shape and size. In the digital realm, information could be molded and shaped and directed to any purpose, like a magical, primordial force of nature.  
从那时起, 我就痴迷于技术在我周围传播信息的潜力。我开始意识到在电脑上做笔记这个简单的行为只是冰山一角。因为一旦数字化, 笔记就不再局限于简短的手写涂鸦——它们可以采用任何形式, 包括图像、链接以及任何形状和大小的文件。在数字领域, 信息可以被塑造和塑造并用于任何目的, 就像一种神奇的、原始的自然力量。

I started using digital notetaking in other parts of my life. In my college classes, I turned stacks of disheveled spiral-bound notebooks into an elegant, searchable collection of lessons. I learned to master the process of writing down only the most important points from my classes, reviewing them on demand, and using them to compose an essay or pass a test. I had always been a mediocre student with average grades. My early schoolteachers would regularly send me home with report cards noting my short attention span and wandering mind. You can imagine my delight when I graduated from college with a nearly straight-A grade point average and university honors.  
我开始在生活的其他方面使用数字笔记。在我的大学课堂上, 我把一堆乱七八糟的螺旋装订笔记本变成了一个优雅的、可搜索的课程集。我学会了只写下课堂上最重要的要点, 按需复习, 并用它们来撰写论文或通过考试的过程。我一直是一个成绩一般的平庸学生。我早期的学校老师会定期将我的成绩单送回家, 上面写着我注意力不集中和走神。你可以想象当我以几乎全 A 的平均成绩和大学荣誉从大学毕业时我的喜悦之情。

I had the misfortune of graduating into one of the worst job markets in a generation, in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. Faced with few employment opportunities in the United States, I decided to join the Peace Corps, an overseas volunteer program that sends Americans to serve in developing countries. I was accepted and assigned to a small school in the eastern Ukrainian countryside, where I would spend two years teaching English to students aged eight to eighteen.  
在 2008 年金融危机之后, 我不幸毕业于一代人最糟糕的就业市场之一。面对在美国几乎没有就业机会, 我决定加入和平队, 这是一个派遣美国人到发展中国家服务的海外志愿者项目。我被录取并分配到乌克兰东部乡村的一所小学校, 在那里我将花两年时间教 8 到 18 岁的学生英语。

Working as a teacher with few resources and little support, my notetaking system once again became my lifeline. I saved examples of lessons and exercises anywhere I found them: from textbooks, websites, and USB drives passed around by other teachers. I mixed and matched English phrases, expressions, and slang into word games to keep my energetic third graders engaged. I taught the older students the basics of personal productivity—how to keep a schedule, how to take notes in class, and how to set goals and plan their education. I will never forget their appreciation as they grew up and used those skills to apply to universities and succeed in their first jobs. Years later, I still regularly receive messages of gratitude as the productivity skills I taught my former students continue to bear fruit in their lives.  
作为一名资源和支持很少的老师, 我的笔记系统再次成为我的生命线。我把课程和练习的例子保存在任何我能找到的地方: 来自教科书、网站和其他老师传递的 USB 驱动器。我将英语短语、表达和俚语混合并匹配到文字游戏 中, 以保持精力充沛的三年级学生的参与。我向年长的学生传授了个人生产力的基础知识——如何制定时间表、如何在课堂上做笔记以及如何设定目标和规划他们的教育。我永远不会忘记他们在成长过程中的感激之情, 并利用这些技能申请大学并在第一份工作中取得成功。多年后, 我仍然经常收到感谢信息, 因为我教给以前学生的生产力技能继续在他们的生活中结出硕果。

I returned to the US after two years of service and was thrilled to land a job as an analyst at a small consulting firm in San Francisco. As excited as I was to start my career, I was also faced with a major challenge: the pace of work was frantic and overwhelming. Moving straight from rural Ukraine to the epicenter of Silicon Valley, I was utterly unprepared for the constant barrage of inputs that is a normal part of modern workplaces. Every day I received hundreds of emails, every hour dozens of messages, and the pings and dings from every device merged into a ceaseless melody of interruption. I remember looking around at my colleagues and wondering, “How can anyone get anything done here? What’s their secret?”  
在服役两年后, 我回到了美国, 很高兴能在旧金山的一家小型咨询公司找到一份分析师的工作。尽管我对开始我的职业生涯感到兴奋, 但我也面临着一个重大挑战: 工作节奏快得让人不知所措。从乌克兰农村直接搬到硅谷的中心, 我对现代工作场所常见的持续不断的投入毫无准备。每天我都会收到数百封电子邮件, 每小时收到数十条消息, 每台设备发出的叮当声汇成了永无止境的中断旋律。我记得我环顾周围的同事并想知道,“这里怎么会有人做任何事情? 他们的秘诀是什么?”

I knew only one trick, and it started with writing things down.  
我只知道一个窍门, 那就是从写下来开始。

I started taking notes on everything I was learning using a notetaking app on my computer. I took notes during meetings, on phone calls, and while doing research online. I wrote down facts gleaned from research papers that could be used in the slides we presented to clients. I wrote down tidbits of insight I came across on social media, to share on our own social channels. I wrote down feedback from my more experienced colleagues so I could make sure I digested it and took it to heart. Every time we started a new project, I created a dedicated place on my computer for the information related to it, where I could sort through it all and decide on a plan of action.  
我开始使用电脑上的笔记应用程序对我所学的一切做笔记。我在开会时、打电话时和在网上做研究时做笔记。我写下了从研究论文中收集到的事实, 这些事实可以用在我们展示给客户的幻灯片中。我写下了我在社交媒体上遇到的一些见解, 以便在我们自己的社交渠道上分享。我写下了我更有经验的同事的反馈, 这样我就可以确保我消化了它并将其牢记在心。每次我们开始一个新项目时, 我都会在我的电脑上创建一个专门的位置来存放相关信息, 在那里我可以整理所有内容并决定行动计划。

As the information tide receded, I started to gain a sense of confidence in my ability to find exactly what I needed when I needed it. I became the go-to person in the office for finding that one file, or unearthing that one fact, or remembering exactly what the client had said three weeks earlier. You know the feeling of satisfaction when you are the only one in the room who remembers an important detail? That feeling became the prize in my personal pursuit to capitalize on the value of what I knew.  
随着信息浪潮退去, 我开始对自己能够在需要时准确找到所需内容的能力产生信心。 我成了办公室里找到那个文件, 或者挖掘那个事实, 或者准确地记住客户三周前说过的话的人。当您是房间里唯一记得重要细节的人时, 您知道那种满足感吗? 这种感觉成为我个人追求利用我所知道的价值的奖品。

### Another Shift—Discovering the Power of Sharing  
另一个转变——发现分享的力量

My collection of notes and files had always been for my own personal use, but as I worked on consulting projects for some of the most important organizations in the world, I started to realize that it could be a business asset as well.  
我收集的笔记和文件一直供我个人使用, 但当我为世界上一些最重要的组织从事咨询项目时, 我开始意识到它也可以成为一种商业资产。

I learned from one of the reports we published that the value of physical capital in the US—land, machinery, and buildings for example—is about $10 trillion, but that value is dwarfed by the total value of _human_ capital, which is estimated to be five to ten times larger. Human capital includes “the knowledge and the knowhow embodied in humans—their education, their experience, their wisdom, their skills, their relationships, their common sense, their intuition.”[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch01fn1)  
我从我们发布的一份报告中了解到, 美国的实物资本价值——例如土地、机器和建筑物——约为 10 万亿美元, 但这个价值与人力资本的总价值相比相形见绌, 据估计大五到十倍。人力资本包括 “体现在人类身上的知识和诀窍——他们的教育、他们的经验、他们的智慧、他们的技能、他们的关系、他们的常识和他们的直觉。” [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch01fn1)

If that was true, was it possible that my personal collection of notes was a knowledge asset that could grow and compound over time? I began to see my as-yet-unnamed Second Brain not just as a notetaking tool but as a loyal confidant and thought partner. When I was forgetful, it always remembered. When I lost my way, it reminded me where we were going. When I felt stuck and at a loss for ideas, it suggested possibilities and pathways.  
如果那是真的, 我个人收集的笔记是否可能是一种知识资产, 可以随着时间的推移而增长和复合? 我开始将我尚未命名的 “第二大脑” 视为不仅仅是一个记笔记工具, 而且是一个忠实的知己和思想伙伴。当我健忘的时候, 它总是记得。当我迷路时, 它提醒我我们要去哪里。当我感到卡壳和不知所措时, 它会建议可能性和途径。

At one point some of my colleagues asked me to teach them my organizing methods. I found that virtually all of them already used various productivity tools, such as paper notepads or the apps on their smartphones, but that very few did so in a systematic, intentional way. They tended to move information around from place to place haphazardly, reacting to the demands of the moment, never quite trusting that they’d be able to find it again. Every new productivity app promised a breakthrough, but usually ended up becoming yet another thing to manage.  
有一次, 我的一些同事请我教他们我的组织方法。我发现几乎所有人都已经使用过各种生产力工具, 例如纸质记事本或智能手机上的应用程序, 但很少有人以系统的、有意识的 方式这样做。他们倾向于随意地将信息从一个地方移动到另一个地方, 对当下的需求做出反应, 从不完全相信他们能够再次找到它。每个新的生产力应用程序都有望取得突破, 但通常最终会成为另一件需要管理的事情。

Casual lunchtime chats with my colleagues turned into a book club, which became a workshop, which eventually evolved into a paid class open to the public. As I taught what I knew to more and more people and saw the immediate difference it made in their work and lives, it began to dawn on me that I had discovered something very special. My experience managing my chronic condition had taught me a way of getting organized that was ideal for solving problems and producing results now, not in some far-off future. Applying that approach to other areas of my life, I had found a way to organize information holistically—for a variety of purposes, for any project or goal—instead of only for one-off tasks. And more than that, I discovered that once I had that information at hand, I could easily and generously share it in all kinds of ways to serve the people around me.  
午餐时间与同事的闲聊变成了读书俱乐部, 又变成了工作坊, 最终演变成向公众开放的付费课程。当我向越来越多的人传授我所知道的知识并看到它对他们的工作和生活产生的直接影响时, 我开始明白我发现了一些非常特别的东西。我管理慢性病的经验教会了我一种组织起来的方法, 这种方法非常适合现在解决问题和产生结果, 而不是在遥远的未来。将这种方法应用到我生活的其他领域, 我找到了一种整体组织信息的方法——为了各种目的, 为了任何项目或目标——而不是仅仅为了一次性任务。更重要的是, 我发现一旦掌握了这些信息, 我就可以轻松、慷慨地以各种方式分享它, 为我周围的人服务。

### The Origins of the Second Brain System  
第二脑系统的起源

I began to call the system I had developed my Second Brain and started a blog to share my ideas about how it worked. These ideas resonated with a much wider audience than I ever expected, and my work was eventually featured in publications such as the _Harvard Business Review_, _The Atlantic_, _Fast Company_, and _Inc._, among others. An article I wrote about how to use digital notetaking to enhance creativity went viral in the productivity community, and I was invited to speak and teach workshops at influential companies like Genentech, Toyota, and the Inter-American Development Bank. In early 2017, I decided to create an online course called “Building a Second Brain” to teach my system on a wider scale.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-042) In the years since, that program has produced thousands of graduates from more than one hundred countries and every walk of life, creating an engaged and inquisitive community where the lessons in this book have been honed and refined.  
我开始称呼我开发第二大脑的系统, 并开始写博客来分享我对它如何工作的想法。这些想法引起了比我预想的更广泛的观众的共鸣, 我的作品最终出现在了《哈佛商业评论》、《大西洋月刊》、《快公司》和《公司》等出版物中。我写的一篇关于如何使用数字笔记来增强创造力的文章在生产力社区迅速传播开来, 我受邀在基因泰克、丰田和美洲开发银行等有影响力的公司演讲和讲授研讨会。 2017 年初, 我决定创建一个名为 “打造第二个大脑” 的在线课程 , 以在更广泛的范围内教授我的系统。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-042) 从那以后的几年里, 该项目培养了来自一百多个国家和各行各业的数千名毕业生, 创建了一个参与和好奇的社区, 本书中的课程得到了磨练和完善。

In the next couple of chapters, I’ll show you how the practice of creating a Second Brain is part of a long legacy of thinkers and creators who came before us—writers, scientists, philosophers, leaders, and everyday people who strived to remember and achieve more. Then I’ll introduce you to a few basic principles and tools you’ll need to set yourself up to succeed. Part Two, “The Method,” introduces each of the four steps you’ll follow to build a Second Brain so you can immediately begin to capture and share ideas with more intention. And Part Three, “Making Things Happen,” offers a set of powerful ways to use your Second Brain to enhance your productivity, accomplish your goals, and thrive in your work and life.  
在接下来的几章中, 我将向你展示创造第二大脑的实践如何成为我们之前的思想家和创造者长期遗产的一部分——作家、科学家、哲学家、领导者, 以及努力记住的普通人并取得更多成就。然后, 我将向您介绍一些基本原则和工具, 您需要这些原则和工具才能成功。第二部分 “方法” 介绍了构建 “第二大脑” 的四个步骤中的每一个, 这样您就可以立即开始更有意图地捕捉和分享想法。第三部分 “让事情发生” 提供了一套强大的方法来使用你的第二大脑来提高你的生产力, 实现你的目标, 并在你的工作和生活中茁壮成长。

I’ve shared my story with you because I want you to know that this book isn’t about perfectly optimizing some kind of idealized life. Everyone experiences pain, makes mistakes, and struggles at some point in their lives. I’ve had my fair share of challenges, but at each stage of my journey, treating my thoughts as treasures worth keeping has been the pivotal element in everything I’ve overcome and achieved.  
我与你分享了我的故事, 因为我想让你知道这本书并不是要完美地优化某种理想化的生活。每个人在生活中的某个时刻都会经历痛苦、犯错和挣扎。我遇到了相当多的挑战, 但在我旅程的每个阶段, 将我的思想视为值得保留的宝藏一直是我克服和取得的一切的关键因素。

You may find this book in the “self-improvement” category, but in a deeper sense it is the opposite of self-improvement. It is about optimizing a _system outside yourself_, a system not subject to your limitations and constraints, leaving you happily unoptimized and free to roam, to wonder, to _wander_ toward whatever makes you feel alive here and now in each moment.  
你可能会发现这本书属于 “自我提升” 的范畴, 但从更深层次的意义上讲, 它是自我提升的对立面。它是关于优化你之外的系统, 一个不受你的限制和束缚的系统, 让你快乐地不受优化, 自由地漫游、思考、漫步到任何让你在此时此地感到活着的东西。

Information is the fundamental building block of everything you do.  
信息是您所做一切的基本组成部分。

Anything you might want to accomplish—executing a project at work, getting a new job, learning a new skill, starting a business—requires finding and putting to use the right information. Your professional success and quality of life depend directly on your ability to manage information effectively.  
您可能想要完成的任何事情——在工作中执行一个项目、找到一份新工作、学习一项新技能、创业——都需要找到并使用正确的信息。您的职业成功和生活质量直接取决于您有效管理信息的能力。

According to the _New York Times_, the average person’s daily consumption of information now adds up to a remarkable 34 gigabytes.[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn1) A separate study cited by the _Times_ estimates that we consume the equivalent of 174 full newspapers’ worth of content each and every day, five times higher than in 1986.[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn2)  
据《纽约时报》报道, 现在普通人每天消耗的信息量总计达到惊人的 34 GB。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn1) 泰晤士报引用的另一项研究估计, 我们每天消耗的内容相当于 174 份完整报纸的内容, 是 1986 年的五倍。 [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn2)

Instead of empowering us, this deluge of information often overwhelms us. Information Overload has become Information Exhaustion, taxing our mental resources and leaving us constantly anxious that we’re forgetting something. Instantaneous access to the world’s knowledge through the Internet was supposed to educate and inform us, but instead it has created a society-wide poverty of attention.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-041)  
大量的信息不但没有赋予我们力量, 反而常常让我们不知所措。信息超载已经成为信息枯竭, 对我们的精神资源造成负担, 让我们一直焦虑 我们忘记了什么。通过互联网即时获取世界知识本来是为了教育和告知我们, 但它却造成了全社会的注意力匮乏。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-041)

Research from Microsoft shows that the average US employee spends 76 hours per year looking for misplaced notes, items, or files.[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn3) And a report from the International Data Corporation found that 26 percent of a typical knowledge worker’s day is spent looking for and consolidating information spread across a variety of systems.[4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn4) Incredibly, only 56 percent of the time are they able to find the information required to do their jobs.  
Microsoft 的研究表明, 美国员工平均每年花费 76 小时寻找放错地方的笔记、项目或文件。 [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn3) 国际数据公司的一份报告发现, 典型的知识工作者每天有 26% 的时间用于查找和整合分布在各种系统中的信息。 [4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn4) 令人难以置信的是, 只有 56% 的时间他们能够找到完成工作所需的信息。

In other words, we go to work five days per week, but spend more than one of those days on average just looking for the information we need to do our work. Half the time, we don’t even succeed in doing that.  
换句话说, 我们每周工作五天, 但平均有超过一天的时间用于寻找工作所需的信息。有一半的时间, 我们甚至没有成功做到这一点。

It’s time for us to upgrade our Paleolithic memory. It’s time to acknowledge that we can’t “use our head” to store everything we need to know and to outsource the job of remembering to intelligent machines. We have to recognize that the cognitive demands of modern life increase every year, but we’re still using the same brains as two hundred thousand years ago, when modern humans first emerged on the plains of East Africa.  
是时候升级我们的旧石器时代记忆了。是时候承认我们不能 “用我们的头脑” 来存储我们需要知道的一切, 并将记忆的工作外包给智能机器。我们必须认识到, 现代生活的认知需求每年都在增加, 但我们仍在使用与 20 万年前相同的大脑, 当时现代人类首次出现在东非平原上。

Every bit of energy we spend straining to recall things is energy not spent doing the thinking that only humans can do: inventing new things, crafting stories, recognizing patterns, following our intuition, collaborating with others, investigating new subjects, making plans, testing theories. Every minute we spend trying to mentally juggle all the stuff we have to do leaves less time for more meaningful pursuits like cooking, self-care, hobbies, resting, and spending time with loved ones.  
我们花在回忆事物上的每一分精力都没有花在只有人类才能做到的思考上: 发明新事物、编造故事、识别模式、跟随我们的直觉、与他人合作、调查新主题、制定计划、检验理论. 我们花在试图在精神上兼顾所有我们必须做的事情的每一分钟都会减少时间来进行更有意义的 追求, 例如烹饪、自我保健、爱好、休息和与亲人共度时光。

However, there’s a catch: every change in how we use technology also requires a change in how we think. To properly take advantage of the power of a Second Brain, we need a new relationship to information, to technology, and even to ourselves.  
然而, 有一个问题: 我们使用技术方式的每一次改变也需要我们思考方式的改变。为了正确地利用第二大脑的力量, 我们需要与信息、技术甚至我们自己建立一种新的关系。

For insight into our own time, we can look to history for lessons on what worked in other eras. The practice of writing down one’s thoughts and notes to help make sense of the world has a long legacy. For centuries, artists and intellectuals from Leonardo da Vinci to Virginia Woolf, from John Locke to Octavia Butler, have recorded the ideas they found most interesting in a book they carried around with them, known as a “commonplace book.”[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-040)  
为了深入了解我们自己的时代, 我们可以从历史中汲取其他时代行之有效的经验教训。写下自己的想法和笔记以帮助理解世界的做法由来已久。几个世纪以来, 从列奥纳多 · 达 · 芬奇到弗吉尼亚 · 伍尔夫, 从约翰 · 洛克到奥克塔维亚 · 巴特勒, 艺术家和知识分子都将他们发现最有趣的想法记录在随身携带的一本书中, 这本书被称为 “平凡之书”。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-040)

Popularized in a previous period of information overload, the Industrial Revolution of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the commonplace book was more than a diary or journal of personal reflections. It was a learning tool that the educated class used to understand a rapidly changing world and their place in it.  
在 18 世纪和 19 世纪初的工业革命时期, 在信息过载的前一个时期得到普及, 这本平凡的书不仅仅是日记或个人反思的日志。它是受过教育的阶层用来了解瞬息万变的世界及其在其中的位置的学习工具。

In _The Case for Books_,[5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn5) historian and former director of the Harvard University Library Robert Darnton explains the role of commonplace books:  
在书籍案例中, [5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn5) 历史学家和哈佛大学图书馆前馆长 Robert Darnton 解释了普通书籍的作用:

> _Unlike modern readers, who follow the flow of a narrative from beginning to end, early modern Englishmen read in fits and_ _starts and jumped from book to book. They broke texts into fragments and assembled them into new patterns by transcribing them in different sections of their notebooks. Then they reread the copies and rearranged the patterns while adding more excerpts. Reading and writing were therefore inseparable activities. They belonged to a continuous effort to make sense of things, for the world was full of signs: you could read your way through it; and by keeping an account of your readings, you made a book of your own, one stamped with your personality._[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-039)  
> 与从头到尾跟随叙述流程的现代读者不同, 早期现代英国人阅读时断断续续, 开始, 从一本书跳到另一本书。他们将文本分解成片段, 并通过将它们转录到笔记本的不同部分来将它们组合成新的模式。然后他们重新阅读副本并重新排列模式, 同时添加更多摘录。因此, 阅读和写作是不可分割的活动。它们属于使事物有意义的持续努力, 因为世界充满了迹象: 你可以通过它阅读你的方式; 通过记下你的阅读记录, 你制作了一本属于你自己的书, 其中印有你的个性。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-039)

Commonplace books were a portal through which educated people interacted with the world. They drew on their notebooks in conversation and used them to connect bits of knowledge from different sources and to inspire their own thinking.  
普通书籍是受过教育的人与世界互动的门户。他们在谈话中利用笔记本, 将不同来源的知识联系起来, 激发自己的思考。

As a society, all of us could benefit from the modern equivalent of a commonplace book. The media landscape of today is oriented toward what is _novel_ and _public_—the latest political controversy, the new celebrity scandal, or the viral meme of the day. Resurrecting the commonplace book allows us to stem the tide, shifting our relationship with information toward the _timeless_ and the _private_.  
作为一个社会, 我们所有人都可以从现代的平庸书籍中受益。当今的媒体格局以新颖和公开的内容为导向——最新的政治争议、新的名人丑闻或当今病毒式传播的模因。复活平凡的书让我们能够遏制潮流, 将我们与信息的关系转向永恒和私人。

Instead of consuming ever-greater amounts of content, we could take on a more patient, thoughtful approach that favors rereading, reformulating, and working through the implications of ideas over time. Not only could this lead to more civil discussions about the important topics of the day; it could also preserve our mental health and heal our splintered attention.  
我们可以采取更耐心、更深思熟虑的方法, 而不是消耗越来越多的内容, 这种方法有利于随着时间的推移重新阅读、重新表述和研究想法的含义。这不仅可以引发对当今重要话题的更多民间讨论; 它还可以保护我们的心理健康并治愈我们分散的注意力。

But this isn’t simply a return to the past. We now have the opportunity to supercharge the custom of commonplace books for the modern era. We have the chance to turn that historical practice into something far more flexible and convenient.  
但这不仅仅是回到过去。我们现在有机会加强现代时代的普通书籍的习俗。我们有机会将这种历史实践变成更加灵活方便的东西。

Once our notes and observations become digital, they can be searched, organized and synced across all our devices, and backed up to the cloud for safekeeping. Instead of randomly scribbling down notes on pieces of paper, hoping we’ll be able to find them later, we can cultivate our very own “knowledge vault” so we always know exactly where to look.  
一旦我们的笔记和观察变成数字化, 就可以在我们所有的设备上搜索、组织和同步它们, 并备份到云端以妥善保管。我们可以培养自己的 “知识库”, 而不是随意在纸上潦草地记下笔记, 希望我们以后能找到它们, 这样我们就总能准确地知道去哪里找。

Writer and photographer Craig Mod wrote, “There is a gaping opportunity to consolidate our myriad marginalia[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-038) into an even more robust commonplace book. One searchable, always accessible, easily shared and embedded amongst the digital text we consume.”[6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn6)  
作家兼摄影师克雷格 · 莫德 (Craig Mod) 写道:“将我们无数的旁注 [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-038) 整合成一本更强大的平凡书, 这是一个巨大的机会。一种可搜索、始终可访问、易于共享和嵌入我们消费的数字文本中的方式。” [6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn6)

This digital commonplace book is what I call a Second Brain. Think of it as the combination of a study notebook, a personal journal, and a sketchbook for new ideas. It is a multipurpose tool that can adapt to your changing needs over time. In school or courses you take, it can be used to take notes for studying. At work, it can help you organize your projects. At home, it can help you manage your household.  
这本通俗易懂的电子书就是我所说的 “第二大脑”。可以将其视为学习笔记本、个人日记和新想法速写本的结合。它是一种多用途工具, 可以随着时间的推移适应您不断变化的需求。在学校或您参加的课程中, 它可以用来做笔记以进行学习。在工作中, 它可以帮助您组织项目。在家里, 它可以帮助您管理家庭。

However you decide to use it, your Second Brain is a private knowledge collection designed to serve a lifetime of learning and growth, not just a single use case. It is a laboratory where you can develop and refine your thinking in solitude before sharing it with others. A studio where you can experiment with ideas until they are ready to be put to use in the outside world. A whiteboard where you can sketch out your ideas and collaborate on them with others.  
无论您决定如何使用它, 您的第二大脑都是一个私人知识集合, 旨在服务于终生学习和成长, 而不仅仅是一个用例。这是一个实验室, 你可以在与 others 分享之前, 在孤独中发展和完善你的想法。一个工作室, 您可以在其中试验想法, 直到它们准备好在外面的世界中使用。一块白板, 您可以在其中勾勒出您的想法并与他人协作。

As soon as you understand that we naturally use digital tools to extend our thinking beyond the bounds of our skulls, you’ll start to see Second Brains everywhere.  
一旦您了解我们自然会使用数字工具将我们的思维扩展到我们头骨的范围之外, 您就会开始到处看到第二大脑。

A calendar app is an extension of your brain’s ability to remember events, ensuring you never forget an appointment. Your smartphone is an extension of your ability to communicate, allowing your voice to reach across oceans and continents. Cloud storage is an extension of your brain’s memory, allowing you to store thousands of gigabytes and access them from anywhere.[V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-037)  
日历应用程序是大脑记忆事件能力的延伸, 确保您永远不会忘记约会。您的智能手机是您沟通能力的延伸, 可以让您的声音跨越海洋和大陆。云存储是大脑记忆的延伸, 允许您存储数千 GB 的数据并从任何地方访问它们。 [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-037)

It’s time to add digital notes to our repertoire and further enhance our natural capabilities using technology.  
是时候将数字笔记添加到我们的曲目中, 并使用技术进一步增强我们的自然能力。

### Rethinking Notetaking: Notes as Knowledge Building Blocks  
重新思考记笔记: 作为知识构建块的笔记

In past centuries, only the intellectual elite needed commonplace books—writers, politicians, philosophers, and scientists who had a reason to synthesize their writing or research.  
在过去的几个世纪里, 只有知识精英需要平庸的书籍——作家、政治家、哲学家和科学家有理由综合他们的著作或研究。

Nowadays, almost everyone needs a way to manage information.  
如今, 几乎每个人都需要一种管理信息的方法。

More than half the workforce today can be considered “knowledge workers”—professionals for whom knowledge is their most valuable asset, and who spend a majority of their time managing large amounts of information. In addition, no matter what our formal role is, all of us have to come up with new ideas, solve novel problems, and communicate with others effectively. We have to do these things regularly, reliably, not just once in a while.  
今天超过一半的劳动力可以被认为是 “知识工作者”——知识是他们最 宝贵资产的专业人士, 他们将大部分时间花在管理大量信息上。此外, 无论我们的正式角色是什么, 我们所有人都必须提出新想法, 解决新问题, 并与他人进行有效沟通。我们必须定期、可靠地做这些事情, 而不是偶尔做一次。

As a knowledge worker, where does your knowledge live? Where does your knowledge go when it’s created or discovered? “Knowledge” can seem like a lofty concept reserved exclusively for scholars and academics, but at the most practical level, knowledge begins with the simple, time-honored practice of taking notes.  
作为知识工作者, 您的知识存在于何处? 当你的知识被创造或发现时, 它去了哪里? “知识” 似乎是专为学者和学者保留的崇高概念, 但在最实用的层面上, 知识始于简单、历史悠久的做笔记。

For many people, their understanding of notetaking was formed in school. You were probably first told to write something down because it would be on the test. This implied that the minute the test was over, you would never reference those notes again. Learning was treated as essentially disposable, with no intention of that knowledge being useful for the long term.  
对于很多人来说, 他们对记笔记的理解是在学校形成的。你可能首先被告知要写下一些东西, 因为它会在测试中。这意味着在测试结束的那一刻, 您将永远不会再参考那些笔记。学习基本上被视为一次性的, 无意使该知识长期有用。

When you enter the professional world, the demands on your notetaking change completely. The entire approach to notetaking you learned in school is not only obsolete, it’s the exact opposite of what you need.  
当您进入专业领域时, 对记笔记的要求会完全改变。你在学校学到的整个记笔记方法不仅已经过时, 而且与你需要的完全相反。

In the professional world: 在专业领域:

*   It’s not at all clear what you should be taking notes on.  
    根本不清楚你应该记笔记什么。
*   No one tells you when or how your notes will be used.  
    没有人告诉您何时或如何使用您的笔记。
*   The “test” can come at any time and in any form.  
    “考验” 可以随时以任何形式到来。
*   You’re allowed to reference your notes at any time, provided you took them in the first place.  
    你可以随时参考你的笔记, 前提是你首先记下了它们。
*   You are expected to take action on your notes, not just regurgitate them.  
    你应该对你的笔记采取行动, 而不仅仅是反省它们。

This isn’t the same notetaking you learned in school. It’s time to elevate the status of notes from test prep and humble scribblings into something far more interesting and dynamic. For modern, professional notetaking, a note is a “knowledge building block”—a discrete unit of information interpreted through your unique perspective and stored outside your head.  
这和你在学校学的笔记不一样。是时候将笔记的状态从考试准备和简陋的涂鸦提升到更有趣和更有活力的东西了。对于现代的专业笔记, 笔记是一个 “知识积木”——一个离散的信息单元, 通过你独特的视角解释并存储在你的头脑之外。

By this definition, a note could include a passage from a book or article that you were inspired by; a photo or image from the web with your annotations; or a bullet-point list of your meandering thoughts on a topic, among many other examples. A note could include a single quote from a film that really struck you, all the way to thousands of words you saved from an in-depth book. The length and format don’t matter—if a piece of content has been interpreted through your lens, curated according to your taste, translated into your own words, or drawn from your life experience, and stored in a secure place, then it qualifies as a note.  
根据这个定义, 笔记可以包含您受到启发的书籍或文章中的一段话; 来自网络的带有您的注释的照片或图像; 或您对某个主题的曲折想法的要点列表, 以及许多其他示例。笔记可以包括真正打动您的电影中的一句话, 一直到您从一本有深度的书中保存的数千个单词。长度和格式无关紧要——如果一段内容已经通过你的镜头进行了解读, 根据你的品味进行了整理, 翻译成你自己的文字, 或者从你的生活经历中汲取灵感, 并存储在一个安全的地方, 那么它就是合格的作为注释。

A knowledge building block is discrete. It stands on its own and has intrinsic value, but knowledge building blocks can also be combined into something much greater—a report, an argument, a proposal, a story.  
知识构建块是离散的。它独立存在并具有内在价值, 但知识构建块也可以组合成更大的东西——一份报告、一个论点、一个提案、一个故事。

Like the LEGO blocks you may have played with as a kid, they can be rapidly searched, retrieved, moved around, assembled, and reassembled into new forms without requiring you to invent anything from scratch. You need to put in the effort to create a note only once, and then you can just mix and match and try out different combinations until something clicks.  
就像您小时候玩过的乐高积木一样, 您可以快速搜索、检索、移动、组装和重新组装成新的形式, 而无需您从头开始发明任何东西。您只需要努力创建一次笔记, 然后您就可以混合搭配并尝试不同的组合, 直到出现咔哒声。

Technology doesn’t just make notetaking more efficient. It transforms the very nature of notes. No longer do we have to write our thoughts on Post-its or notepads that are fragile, easy to lose, and impossible to search. Now we write notes in the cloud, and the cloud follows us everywhere. No longer do we have to spend countless hours meticulously cataloging and transcribing our thoughts on paper. Now we collect knowledge building blocks and spend our time imagining the possibilities for what they could become.  
技术不仅可以提高记笔记的效率。它改变了音符的本质。我们不再需要将想法写在易碎、容易丢失且无法搜索的便利贴或记事本上。现在我们在云里写笔记, 云也跟着我们到处走。我们不再需要花费无数小时 在纸上精心编目和转录我们的想法。现在我们收集知识积木并花时间想象它们可能成为什么样的可能性。

### A Tale of Two Brains 两个大脑的故事

Let me paint a picture of a day in the life of someone who doesn’t have a Second Brain, and someone who does. See if either of these descriptions sounds familiar.  
让我描绘一幅没有第二大脑的人和有第二脑的人一天的生活。看看这些描述是否听起来很熟悉。

Nina wakes up on Monday morning, and before her eyes even open, thoughts are flooding her brain. Things to do, things to think about, things to decide. It all comes rushing in from the depths of her subconscious, where it’s been simmering all weekend.  
妮娜在星期一早上醒来, 还没等她睁开眼睛, 思绪就涌入了她的脑海。要做的事, 想的事, 决定的事。这一切都从她的潜意识深处涌入, 整个周末都在那里酝酿。

Nina’s thoughts continue to swirl around her brain as she gets ready for work. Like jittery birds, they flit and flutter around her head because they have nowhere else to rest. There is a constant hum of background anxiety that she has come to expect, as she wonders what needs her attention and what she may be missing.  
准备工作时, 尼娜的思绪继续在她的脑海中盘旋。它们像惊慌失措的鸟儿一样, 在她的头上飞来飞去, 因为它们无处可歇。当她想知道什么需要她注意以及她可能遗漏了什么时, 她已经开始预料到背景焦虑会持续嗡嗡作响。

After a hectic morning, Nina finally sits down at her desk to start her workday, opens up her email inbox, and is instantly engulfed by a torrent of new messages. Flashing with urgent subject lines and the names of important senders, these demands fill her with a cold adrenaline rush. She knows that her morning is shot, her own plans ruined. Pushing aside the important work she wanted to focus on this morning, Nina settles in for a long slog of replying to emails.  
经过一个忙碌的早晨, 尼娜终于坐在办公桌前开始她的一天工作, 打开她的电子邮件收件箱, 立即被大量新邮件吞没。这些要求闪烁着紧急的主题行和重要发件人的名字, 让她感到肾上腺素激增。她知道她的早晨已经结束, 她自己的计划毁了。将今天早上她想专注的重要工作搁置一旁, 妮娜开始了漫长的回复电子邮件的工作。

By the time she gets back from lunch, Nina is finally done handling the most urgent issues. It’s finally time to focus on the priorities she’s set for herself. This is when the reality sets in: after a morning spent fighting fires, she’s far too scatterbrained and tired to focus. Like so many times before, Nina lowers her expectations, settling for chipping away slowly at her ever-expanding to-do list full of other people’s priorities.  
等她吃完午饭回来时, 尼娜终于处理完了最紧迫的问题。终于到了专注于她为自己设定的优先事项的时候了。这就是现实出现的时候: 经过一个上午的救火工作后, 她心不在焉, 疲惫不堪, 无法集中注意力。像以前很多次一样, 尼娜降低了她的期望, 慢慢地减少了她不断扩大的待办事项清单, 其中充满了其他人的优先事项。

After work, Nina has one last chance to work on the project that she knows will make use of her talents and take her career to the next level. She exercises, eats dinner, and spends some quality time with the kids. As they go to bed, she’s filled with enthusiasm that she finally gets some time to herself.  
下班后, 尼娜有最后一次机会从事她知道可以发挥她的才能并将她的事业提升到一个新水平的项目。她锻炼身体, 吃晚饭, 并与孩子们共度美好时光。当他们上床睡觉时, 她充满了热情, 因为她终于有了一些属于自己的时间。

She sits down at the computer, and the questions begin: “Where did I leave off last time? Where did I put that file? Where are all my notes?”  
她在电脑前坐下, 问题开始了:“我上次在哪里停下来了? 我把那个文件放在哪里了? 我所有的笔记在哪里?

By the time Nina gets set up and ready to go, she’s far too tired to make real progress. This pattern repeats itself day after day. After enough of these false starts, she starts to give up. Why even try? Why keep attempting to do the impossible? Why resist the temptation to watch another Netflix episode or scroll through social media? Without the time and energy to move things decisively forward, what’s the point of starting?  
当 Nina 准备好出发时, 她已经累得无法取得真正的进展。这种模式日复一日地重复着。在这些错误的开始足够多之后, 她开始放弃。为什么还要尝试? 为什么要不断尝试做不可能的事? 为什么要抵制观看另一集 Netflix 剧集或滚动浏览社交媒体的诱惑? 如果没有时间和精力果断地推动事情向前发展, 那么开始的意义何在?

Nina is a competent, responsible, and hardworking professional. Many people would feel privileged to be in her shoes. There’s nothing wrong with the work she does or the life she leads, yet underneath the respectable exterior, there is something missing. She isn’t meeting her own standards for what she knows she’s capable of. There are experiences that she wants for herself and her family that seem to continuously get postponed, waiting for “someday” when somehow she will have the time and space to make them happen.  
Nina 是一位称职、负责任且勤奋的专业人士。许多人会觉得身处她的位置而感到荣幸。她所做的工作或她过的生活没有任何问题, 但在可敬的外表下, 却少了一些东西。她没有达到自己所知道的能力标准。她想要为自己和家人带来的体验似乎不断被推迟, 等待 “某一天”, 那时她将有时间和空间以某种方式实现它们。

Does anything about Nina’s experience sound familiar? Every detail of her story is real, drawn from messages people have sent me over the years. Their stories convey a pervasive feeling of discontent and dissatisfaction—the experience of facing an endless onslaught of demands on their time, their innate curiosity and imagination withering away under the suffocating weight of obligation.  
尼娜的经历有什么听起来很熟悉吗? 她故事的每一个细节都是真实的, 取自人们多年来给我发来的信息。他们的故事传达了一种普遍的不满和不满情绪——面对无休止的时间需求冲击的经历, 他们与生俱来的好奇心和想象力在令人窒息的义务重压下逐渐消亡。

So many of us share the feeling that we are surrounded by knowledge, yet starving for wisdom. That despite all the mind-expanding ideas we have access to, the quality of our attention is only getting worse. That we are paralyzed by the conflict between our responsibilities and our most heartfelt passions, so that we’re never quite able to focus and also never quite able to rest.  
我们中的许多人都有这样一种感觉, 即我们被知识包围, 却又渴望智慧。尽管我们可以获得所有扩展思维的 ideas, 但我们注意力的质量只会越来越差。我们因责任和最发自内心的热情之间的冲突而瘫痪, 以至于我们永远无法集中注意力, 也永远无法休息。

There is an alternative story. A different way a Monday morning can go. It is also drawn from the real-life stories I’ve received, this time from people who have built a Second Brain for themselves.  
还有一个故事。周一早上可以有不同的方式。它也取材于我收到的真实故事, 这次是来自那些为自己建造第二大脑的人。

You wake up Monday morning, looking forward to starting your day and your week. As you get out of bed, take a shower, and get dressed, the thoughts start arriving. You have just as many worries and responsibilities as anyone else, but you also have a secret weapon.  
您在星期一早上醒来, 期待着开始新的一天和新的一周。当你起床、洗澡、穿好衣服时, 思绪开始涌现。你和其他人一样有很多烦恼和责任, 但你也有一个秘密武器。

In the shower, you suddenly realize there’s a better way to advance the project you’re focused on at work. As you step out onto the mat, you jot down the idea as a digital note on your smartphone. Over breakfast with your family, you find your mind already working out the new strategy, pondering its implications. Those thoughts get jotted down as well, in the brief moments between feeding the kids and sending them off to school. As you drive to work, you start realizing there are challenges you haven’t considered. You dictate a quick audio memo to your phone as you drive, which gets automatically transcribed and saved in your notes.  
在淋浴时, 您突然意识到有更好的方法来推进您在工作中专注的项目。当您走上垫子时, 您会在智能手机上以数字笔记的形式记下这个想法。与家人共进早餐时, 您会发现自己的头脑已经在制定新策略, 并思考其含义。在喂养孩子和送他们上学之间的短暂时刻, 这些想法也会被记下来。当您开车上班时, 您开始意识到有些挑战是您没有考虑过的。您在开车时向手机口述一个快速的音频备忘录, 它会自动转录并保存在您的笔记中。

Monday morning in the office is the usual whirlwind, with emails and chat messages and phone calls arriving at their usual frantic pace. As you share your new idea with your colleagues, they start asking questions, pointing out valid concerns, and adding their own contributions. At each of these moments, you are ready to save them as notes in your Second Brain. You withhold judgment, seeking to gather the widest possible range of feedback before deciding on a course of action.  
周一早上, 办公室里如往常一样旋风般的袭来, 电子邮件、聊天信息和电话都以他们通常的疯狂速度到达。当您与同事分享您的新想法时, 他们会开始提问、指出合理的顾虑并添加他们自己的贡献。在这些时刻中的每一个时刻, 你都准备好将它们作为笔记保存在你的第二大脑中。你保留判断力, 在决定采取行动之前寻求收集尽可能广泛的反馈。

Before you know it, it’s lunchtime. As you take a break to grab a bite to eat, your thoughts turn philosophical: “What is the ultimate point of the project, and are we forgetting it? How does it fit into the long-term vision of the product we want to build? What is the impact of the new strategy on shareholders, customers, suppliers, and the environment?” You have only thirty minutes to eat lunch, and you don’t have time to ponder these questions in depth, but you note them down as a reminder to think about later.  
不知不觉中, 午餐时间到了。当你休息一下吃点东西时, 你的想法变得哲学化:“项目的最终 点是什么, 我们忘记了吗? 它如何适应我们想要构建的产品的长期愿景? 新战略对股东、客户、供应商和环境有何影响?” 你只有三十分钟吃午饭, 你没有时间深入思考这些问题, 但你把它们记下来, 以备日后思考。

You are on your smartphone just like everyone else, but you aren’t doing what they are doing. You are creating value instead of killing time.  
你和其他人一样都在使用智能手机, 但你并没有做他们正在做的事情。你是在创造价值而不是消磨时间。

By the time the afternoon meeting comes around to review the strategy you’ve come up with, you already have a formidable collection of notes ready and waiting: the ideas, strategies, objectives, challenges, questions, concerns, contributions, and reminders you’ve collected over just a few hours on a Monday morning.  
当下午的会议开始审查你提出的策略时, 你已经准备好了一大堆笔记: 你的想法、策略、目标、挑战、问题、疑虑、贡献和提醒。我在周一早上收集了几个小时。

You take ten minutes before the meeting starts to organize your notes. About a third of them aren’t a priority, and you put them aside. Another third are critical, and you make them into an agenda for the meeting. The remaining third are somewhere in between, and you put them into a separate list to refer to if appropriate.  
你在会议开始前花十分钟整理你的笔记。其中大约三分之一不是优先事项, 您将它们放在一边。另外三分之一是关键的, 你将它们纳入会议议程。剩下的三分之一介于两者之间, 您将它们放在一个单独的列表中以供参考。

As the meeting begins, the team sits down to start discussing the project. You are already prepared. You’ve already considered the biggest problems from several different angles, mapped out a number of possible solutions, and started thinking about the big-picture implications. You’ve even received feedback from some of your colleagues and incorporated it into your recommendations. You argue for your point of view while also remaining open to the perspectives of your team. Your goal is to stay present and guide the conversation to the best possible outcome, making use of everyone’s unique way of seeing things. All the important reflections, new ideas, and unexpected possibilities your colleagues come up with also get recorded in your Second Brain.  
会议开始时, 团队坐下来开始讨论项目。你已经准备好了。你已经从几个不同的角度考虑了最大的问题, 制定了一些可能的解决方案, 并开始考虑全局影响。您甚至收到了一些同事的反馈, 并将其纳入您的建议中。您为自己的观点争论不休, 同时也对团队的观点持开放态度。您的目标是保持在场并引导对话取得最佳结果, 利用每个人看待事物的独特方式。您的同事提出的所有重要思考、新想法和意想不到的可能性也会记录在您的第二大脑中。

As this way of working with information continues over days and weeks and months, the way your mind works begins to change. You start to see recurring patterns in your thinking: why you do things, what you really want, and what’s really important to you. Your Second Brain becomes like a mirror, teaching you about yourself and reflecting back to you the ideas worth keeping and acting on. Your mind starts to become intertwined with this system, leaning on it to remember more than you ever could on your own.  
随着这种处理信息的方式持续数日、数周和数月, 您的思维方式开始发生变化。你开始在你的思维中看到反复出现的模式: 你为什么做事, 你真正想要什么, 什么对你真正重要。你的第二大脑就像一面镜子, 教你了解你自己, 并向你反映出值得坚持和付诸行动的想法。你的思想开始与这个系统交织在一起, 依靠它来记住比你自己记住的更多。

All this is literally not just in your head. People can tell there is something different about you. They start to recognize that you can draw on an unusually large body of knowledge at a moment’s notice. They remark on your amazing memory, but what they don’t know is that you never even try to remember anything. They admire your incredible dedication to developing your thinking over time. In reality, you are just planting seeds of inspiration and harvesting them as they flower.  
所有这一切实际上不仅仅是在你的脑海中。人们可以看出你与众不同。他们开始认识到, 您可以立即利用异常庞大的知识体系。他们评论你惊人的记忆力, 但他们不知道的是你甚至从未试图记住任何东西。他们钦佩你随着时间的推移发展你的思维的不可思议的奉献精神。事实上, 你只是在播下灵感的种子, 并在它们开花时收获它们。

As you begin to see all the knowledge you’ve gained in tangible form, it dawns on you that you already have everything you need to strike out toward the future you want. There’s no need to wait until you’re perfectly prepared. No need to consume more information or do more research. All that’s left is for you to take action on what you already know and already have, which is laid out before you in meticulous detail.  
当你开始以有形的形式看到你获得的所有知识时, 你就会明白你已经拥有了向你想要的未来进军所需的一切。无需等到您做好充分准备。无需消耗更多信息或进行更多研究。剩下的就是让你根据你已经知道和已经拥有的东西采取行动, 这些细节已经摆在你面前。

Your brain is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, which means you have all the bandwidth you need to pursue any endeavor and make it successful. This sense of confidence in the quality of your thinking gives you the freedom to ask deeper questions and the courage to pursue bigger challenges. You can’t fail, because failure is just more information, to be captured and used as fuel for your journey.  
您的大脑不再是您潜力的瓶颈, 这意味着您拥有追求任何努力并取得成功所需的全部带宽。这种对思维质量的自信让你可以自由地提出更深层次的问题, 并有勇气去迎接更大的挑战。你不能失败, 因为失败只是更多的信息, 可以被捕获并用作你旅程的燃料。

This is what it’s like to build and harness the power of a Second Brain.  
这就是建立和利用第二大脑的力量的感觉。

### Leveraging Technology as Thinking Tools  
利用技术作为思维工具

Throughout the twentieth century, a series of scholars and innovators[7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn7) offered a vision for how technology could change humanity for the better. They dreamed of creating an “extended mind” that would amplify human intellect and help us solve the greatest problems facing society.[VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-036) The possibility of such a technological marvel shined like a beacon for the future, promising to liberate knowledge from dusty old books and make it universally accessible and useful.[VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-035)  
在整个二十世纪, 一系列学者和创新者 [7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch02fn7) 提出了技术如何让人类变得更好的愿景。他们梦想创造一种 “扩展的思维”, 可以增强人类的智慧, 帮助我们解决社会面临的最大问题。 [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-036) 这种技术奇迹的可能性就像未来的灯塔一样闪耀, 承诺将知识从布满灰尘的旧书本中解放出来, 并使人人都可以访问和使用它。 [VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-035)

Their efforts were not in vain. Those ideas inspired much of the technology that we use every day, but paradoxically, despite all the technological inventions of the Information Age, we are in some ways further from their original vision than ever. We spend hours every day interacting with social media updates that will be forgotten in minutes. We bookmark articles to read later, but rarely find the time to revisit them again. We create documents that are used once and then get abandoned in the abyss of our email or file systems. So much of our intellectual output—from brainstorms to photos to planning to research—all too often is left stranded on hard drives or lost somewhere in the cloud.  
他们的努力没有白费。这些想法启发了我们每天使用的许多技术, 但矛盾的是, 尽管信息时代出现了所有技术发明, 但我们在某些方面比以往任何时候都离他们最初的愿景更远。我们每天花费数小时与社交媒体更新进行交互, 而这些更新将在几分钟内被遗忘。我们为文章添加书签以便稍后阅读, 但很少有时间再次访问它们。我们创建的文档只使用一次, 然后就被遗弃在我们的电子邮件或文件系统的深渊中。我们的大量智力成果——从头脑风暴到照片、计划再到研究——常常被搁置在硬盘上或丢失在云端的某个地方。

I believe that we have reached an inflection point, where technology has become sufficiently advanced and user-friendly that we can integrate it with our biological brains. Computers have become smaller, more powerful, and more intuitive, to the point that they are unmistakably an essential component of how we think.  
我相信我们已经达到了一个转折点, 技术已经变得足够先进和用户友好, 我们 可以将它与我们的生物大脑结合起来。计算机变得更小、更强大、更直观, 以至于它们无疑是我们思考方式的重要组成部分。

The time has come for us to realize the vision of technology’s early pioneers—that everyone should have an extended mind not just to remember more and be more productive, but to lead more fulfilling lives.  
现在是我们实现技术早期先驱者愿景的时候了——每个人都应该有一个扩展的思维, 不仅要记住更多、更有效率, 还要过上更充实的生活。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-041-backlink). Herbert Simon, an American economist and cognitive psychologist, wrote, “What information consumes is rather obvious: it consumes the attention of its recipients. Hence a wealth of information creates a poverty of attention...”  
    我 。美国经济学家和认知心理学家赫伯特 · 西蒙写道:“信息消耗的东西相当明显: 它消耗了接收者的注意力。因此, 大量的信息造成了注意力的匮乏......”
2.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-040-backlink). The word “commonplace” can be traced back to Ancient Greece, where a speaker in law courts or political meetings would keep an assortment of arguments in a “common place” for easy reference.  
    二。 “commonplace” 这个词可以追溯到古希腊, 在法庭或政治会议上发言的人会把各种论点放在一个 “共同的地方”, 以便于参考。
3.  [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-039-backlink). The practice of keeping personal notes also arose in other countries, such as _biji_ in China (roughly translated as “notebook”), which could contain anecdotes, quotations, random musings, literary criticism, short fictional stories, and anything else that a person thought worth recording. In Japan, _zuihitsu_ (known as “pillow books”) were collections of notebooks used to document a person’s life.  
    三、保留个人笔记的做法在其他国家也出现了, 例如中国的 biji(大致翻译为 “笔记本”), 其中可以包含轶事、语录、随意的沉思、文学评论、短篇小说以及一个人想到的任何其他内容值得记录。在日本, zuihitsu(被称为“枕边书”) 是用来记录一个人生活的笔记本集。
4.  [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-038-backlink). “Marginalia” refers to the marks made in the margins of a book or other document, including scribbles, comments, annotations, critiques, doodles, or illustrations.  
    四、 “旁注” 是指在书籍或其他文件的页边空白处做的标记, 包括涂鸦、评论、注释、评论、涂鸦或插图。
5.  [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-037-backlink). Have you ever lost your smartphone or been unable to access the Internet, and felt like a critical part of yourself was missing? That’s a sign that an external tool has become an extension of your mind. In a 2004 study, Angelo Maravita and Atsushi Iriki discovered that when monkeys and humans consistently use a tool to extend their reach, such as using a rake to reach an object, certain neural networks in the brain change their “map” of the body to include the new tool. This fascinating finding reinforces the idea that external tools can and often do become a natural extension of our minds.  
    诉。您是否曾经丢失了智能手机或无法访问互联网, 并且觉得自己缺少了一个重要的部分? 这表明外部工具已成为您思维的延伸。在 2004 年的一项研究中, Angelo Maravita 和 Atsushi Iriki 发现, 当猴子和人类持续使用某种工具来扩大它们的触及范围时, 例如使用耙子够到一个物体时, 大脑中的某些神经网络会改变它们的身体 “地图” 以包括新工具。这一引人入胜的发现强化了这样一种观点, 即外部工具可以而且经常确实成为我们思维的自然延伸。
6.  [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-036-backlink). Recent advancements and discoveries in the field of “extended cognition” have shed new light on how practical and powerful it can be to “think outside the brain.” This book isn’t focused on the science, but for an excellent introduction to extended cognition I recommend _The Extended Mind_ by Annie Murphy Paul.  
    六. “延展认知”领域的最新进展和发现揭示了 “跳出大脑思考” 的实用性和强大性。这本书并不侧重于科学, 但为了对延展认知进行出色的介绍, 我推荐 Annie Murphy Paul 的 The Extended Mind。
7.  [VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-035-backlink). Vannevar Bush wrote of a “scholar’s workstation” called a “Memex,” which was “a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.”  
    七。 Vannevar Bush 描述了一个名为 “Memex” 的“学者工作站”, 它是“一个个人存储他所有书籍、记录和通信的设备, 并且是机械化的, 因此可以以超快的速度和灵活性进行查询。这是对他记忆的一种放大的亲密补充。”

Chapter 3 How a Second Brain Works  
第 3 章 第二大脑如何工作

> It is in the power of remembering that the self’s ultimate freedom consists. I am free because I remember.  
> 自我的最终自由在于记住的力量。我是自由的, 因为我记得。

Think of your Second Brain as the world’s best personal assistant.  
将您的第二大脑想象成世界上最好的私人助理。

It is perfectly reliable and totally consistent. It is always ready and waiting to capture any bit of information that might be of value to you. It follows directions, makes helpful suggestions, and reminds you of what’s important to you.  
它非常可靠且完全一致。它随时准备好等待捕获任何可能对您有价值的信息。它遵循指示, 提出有用的建议, 并提醒您什么对您很重要。

What would the job description for such a personal assistant look like? What “jobs” would you hire them to do for you? The same way you would hold your assistant accountable to a certain standard of performance, the same is true for your Second Brain. You need to know what it should be doing for you so you know if it’s worth keeping around.  
这样的私人助理的职位描述是什么样的? 你会雇用他们为你做哪些 “工作”? 就像你让你的助手对一定的表现标准负责一样, 你的第二大脑也是如此。您需要知道它应该为您做什么, 这样您才能知道它是否值得保留。

In this chapter we’ll see how the four main capabilities of a Second Brain will actively work for you—immediately and over time; the one basic tool you’ll need to get started; how your Second Brain will evolve to serve what is most important to you; and, finally, an introduction to the four steps of the CODE Method that lies at the heart of it all.  
在本章中, 我们将看到第二大脑的四项主要能力如何为你积极地工作——立即和随着时间的推移; 入门所需的一个基本工具; 你的第二大脑将如何进化以服务于你最重要的东西; 最后, 介绍处于核心位置的 CODE 方法的四个步骤。

There are four essential capabilities that we can rely on a Second Brain to perform for us:  
我们可以依靠第二大脑为我们执行四种基本功能:

1.  Making our ideas concrete. 让我们的想法具体化。
2.  Revealing new associations between ideas.  
    揭示想法之间的新关联。
3.  Incubating our ideas over time. 随着时间的推移孵化我们的想法。
4.  Sharpening our unique perspectives.  
    锐化我们独特的观点。

Let’s examine each of these. 让我们检查每一个。

#### Second Brain Superpower #1: Make Our Ideas Concrete  
第二大脑超级大国 #1: 让我们的想法具体化

Before we do anything with our ideas, we have to “off-load” them from our minds and put them into concrete form. Only when we declutter our brain of complex ideas can we think clearly and start to work with those ideas effectively.  
在我们用我们的想法做任何事情之前, 我们必须将它们从我们的脑海中 “卸下” 并付诸实践。只有当我们整理大脑中复杂的想法时, 我们才能清晰地思考并开始有效地处理这些想法。

In 1953, American biologist James Watson and English physicist Francis Crick made a profound discovery: the structure of DNA was a double helix. Their discovery was built on the groundwork laid by other pioneers, including advancements in X-ray crystallography by Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins, and ushered in a golden age in molecular biology and genetics.  
1953 年, 美国生物学家詹姆斯 · 沃森和英国物理学家弗朗西斯 · 克里克有了重大发现: DNA 的结构是双螺旋结构。他们的发现建立在其他先驱奠定的基础之上, 包括罗莎琳德富兰克林和莫里斯威尔金斯在 X 射线晶体学方面的进步, 并开创了分子生物学和遗传学的黄金时代。

Watson and Crick’s breakthrough is well recognized, but there is a part of their story that is much less well known. An important tool of the researchers was building physical models, an approach they borrowed from American biochemist Linus Pauling. They made cardboard cutouts to approximate the shapes of the molecules they knew were part of DNA’s makeup and, like a puzzle, experimented with different ways of putting them together. They would shift around their models on their desktops, trying to find a shape that fit everything they knew about how the molecules were arranged. The double helix structure seemed to fit all known constraints, allowing the complementary base pairs to fit together perfectly while respecting the ratios between elements that had been measured previously.[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn1)  
沃森和克里克的突破广为人知, 但他们的故事中有一部分鲜为人知。研究人员的一个重要工具是建立物理模型, 这是他们从美国生物化学家 Linus Pauling 那里借来的方法。他们制作纸板切口以近似他们所知道的分子的形状 是 DNA 构成的一部分, 并且像拼图一样, 尝试用不同的方式将它们组合在一起。他们会在他们的桌面上移动他们的模型, 试图找到一个适合他们所知道的关于分子排列方式的一切的形状。双螺旋结构似乎符合所有已知的限制, 允许互补的碱基对完美地结合在一起, 同时尊重先前测量的元素之间的比率。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn1)

This is a remarkable aspect of one of the most famous scientific discoveries of the last century: at the decisive moment, even highly trained scientists deeply familiar with mathematical and abstract thinking turned to the most basic, ancient medium available: physical stuff.  
这是上个世纪最著名的科学发现之一的一个非凡方面: 在决定性的时刻, 即使是训练有素、非常熟悉数学和抽象思维的科学家也转向了最基本、最古老的可用媒介: 物理材料。

Digital notes aren’t physical, but they are visual. They turn vague concepts into tangible entities that can be observed, rearranged, edited, and combined together. They may exist only in virtual form, but we can still see them with our eyes and move them around with our fingers. As researchers Deborah Chambers and Daniel Reisberg found in their research on the limits of mental visualization, “The skills we have developed for dealing with the external world go beyond those we have for dealing with the internal world.”[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn2)  
数字笔记不是物理的, 而是视觉的。它们将模糊的概念变成可以观察、重新排列、编辑和组合在一起的有形实体。它们可能只是以虚拟的形式存在, 但我们仍然可以用眼睛看到它们, 用手指移动它们。正如研究人员黛博拉 · 钱伯斯 (Deborah Chambers) 和丹尼尔 · 赖斯伯格 (Daniel Reisberg) 在他们对心理想象的局限性的研究中发现的那样,“我们为处理外部世界而开发的技能超越了我们处理内部世界的技能。” [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn2)

#### Second Brain Superpower #2: Reveal New Associations Between Ideas  
第二大脑超级大国 #2: 揭示思想之间的新关联

In its most practical form, creativity is about connecting ideas together, especially ideas that don’t seem to be connected.  
在最实际的形式中, 创造力就是将想法联系在一起, 尤其是那些似乎没有联系的想法。

Neuroscientist Nancy C. Andreasen, in her extensive research on highly creative people including accomplished scientists, mathematicians, artists, and writers, came to the conclusion that “Creative people are better at recognizing relationships, making associations and connections.”[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn3)  
神经科学家 Nancy C. Andreasen 在对包括有成就的科学家、数学家、艺术家和作家在内的极富创造力的人进行广泛研究后得出结论:“有创造力的人更善于识别关系、建立联想和建立联系。” [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn3)

By keeping diverse kinds of material in one place, we facilitate this connectivity and increase the likelihood that we’ll notice an unusual association.  
通过将不同种类的材料放在一个地方, 我们促进了这种联系, 并增加了我们注意到不寻常关联的可能性。

Quotes from a philosophy book written in ancient times might sit next to the latest clever tweet. Screenshots from an interesting YouTube video can live right by scenes from classic movies. An audio memo might be saved alongside project plans, a link to a helpful website, and a PDF with the latest research findings. All these formats can be combined in a way that would be impossible in the physical world.  
古代哲学书中的引述可能会放在最新的聪明推文旁边。有趣的 YouTube 视频的屏幕截图可以与经典电影中的场景相得益彰。音频备忘录可能与项目计划、有用网站的链接以及包含最新研究成果的 PDF 一起保存。所有这些格式都可以以在物理世界中不可能的方式组合。

If you’ve ever played the word-tile game Scrabble, you know the best way to come up with new words is to mix up the letters in different combinations until a word jumps out at you. In our Second Brain we can do the same: mix up the order of our ideas until something unexpected emerges. The more diverse and unusual the material you put into it in the first place, the more original the connections that will emerge.  
如果您曾经玩过拼字游戏, 您就会知道想出新单词的最佳方法是将字母以不同的组合混合, 直到一个单词跳出来。在我们的第二大脑中, 我们可以做同样的事情: 混合我们想法的顺序, 直到出现意想不到的事情。您首先放入其中的材料越多样化和不寻常, 就会出现越原始的联系。

#### Second Brain Superpower #3: Incubate Our Ideas Over Time  
第二大脑超级大国 #3: 随着时间的推移孵化我们的想法

Too often when we take on a task—planning an event, designing a product, or leading an initiative—we draw only on the ideas we have access to right in that moment. I call this approach a “heavy lift”—demanding instantaneous results from our brains without the benefit of a support system.  
很多时候, 当我们承担一项任务时——计划活动、设计产品或领导一项计划——我们只会利用我们当时能获得的想法。我称这种方法为 “繁重的工作”——要求我们的大脑在没有支持系统的情况下立即产生结果。

Even when we do a brainstorm, that still relies only on ideas that we can think up right now. What are the chances that the most creative, most innovative approaches will instantly be top of mind? What are the odds that the best way to move forward is one of the first ways we come up with?  
即使当我们进行头脑风暴时, 那仍然只依赖于我们现在可以想到的想法。最具创意、最具创新性的方法立即成为首要考虑因素的可能性有多大? 最好的前进方式是我们首先想到的方式之一的可能性有多大?

This tendency is known as _recency bias_.[4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn4) We tend to favor the ideas, solutions, and influences that occurred to us most recently, regardless of whether they are the best ones. Now imagine if you were able to unshackle yourself from the limits of the present moment, and draw on weeks, months, or even years of accumulated imagination.  
这种倾向被称为近因偏差。 [4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn4) 我们倾向于支持最近发生在我们身上的想法、解决方案和影响, 不管它们是否是最好的。现在想象一下, 如果你能够摆脱当下的束缚, 并利用数周、数月甚至数年积累的想象力。

I call this approach the “slow burn”—allowing bits of thought matter to slowly simmer like a delicious pot of stew brewing on the stove. It is a calmer, more sustainable approach to creativity that relies on the gradual accumulation of ideas, instead of all-out binges of manic hustle. Having a Second Brain where lots of ideas can be permanently saved for the long term turns the passage of time into your friend, instead of your enemy.  
我将这种方法称为 “缓慢燃烧”——让一些思想物质像在炉子上煮一锅美味的炖菜一样慢慢炖煮。这是一种更平静、更可持续的创造力方法, 它依赖于想法的逐渐积累, 而不是全力以赴的狂躁喧嚣。拥有一个可以长期永久保存大量想法的第二大脑, 可以将时间的流逝变成你的朋友, 而不是你的敌人。

#### Second Brain Superpower #4: Sharpen Our Unique Perspectives  
第二脑超能力 #4: 锐化我们独特的视角

Until now we’ve talked mostly about gathering the ideas of others, but the ultimate purpose of a Second Brain is to allow your own thinking to shine.  
到目前为止, 我们主要讨论的是收集他人的想法, 但第二大脑的最终目的是让你自己的想法大放异彩。

A recent study from Princeton University found that there is a certain kind of job that is least likely to be automated by machines in coming years. Surprisingly, it wasn’t jobs that required advanced skills or years of training that were predicted to fare best. It was jobs that required the ability to convey “not just information but a particular interpretation of information.”[5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn5)  
普林斯顿大学最近的一项研究发现, 有一种工作在未来几年最不可能被机器自动化。令人惊讶的是, 预计情况最好的工作并不是需要高级技能或多年培训的工作。这些工作需要能够传达 “不仅是信息, 而且是对信息的特定解释”。 [5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn5)

In other words, the jobs that are most likely to stick around are those that involve promoting or defending a particular perspective. Think of a fundraising organizer sharing stories of the impact their nonprofit has made, a researcher using data to back up their interpretation of an experiment, or a project manager citing a couple of key precedents to support a decision. Our careers and businesses depend more than ever on our ability to advance a particular point of view and persuade others to adopt it as well.[6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn6)  
换句话说, 最有可能留下来的工作是那些涉及促进或捍卫特定观点的工作。想想一个筹款组织者分享他们的非营利组织所产生的影响的故事, 一个研究人员使用数据来支持他们对实验的解释, 或者一个项目经理引用几个关键先例来支持一个决定。我们的职业和企业比以往任何时候都更依赖于我们提出特定观点并说服他人也采纳它的能力。 [6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn6)

Advocating for a particular point of view isn’t just a matter of sparkling charisma or irresistible charm. It takes supporting material.  
倡导特定观点不仅仅是闪耀魅力或不可抗拒的魅力的问题。它需要辅助材料。

American journalist, author, and filmmaker Sebastian Junger once wrote on the subject of “writer’s block”: “It’s not that I’m blocked. It’s that I don’t have enough research to write with power and knowledge about that topic. It always means, not that I can’t find the right words, [but rather] that I don’t have the ammunition.”[7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn7)  
美国记者、作家和电影制作人塞巴斯蒂安 · 荣格尔曾就 “作家的瓶颈” 这一主题写道:“不是我被屏蔽了。这是因为我没有足够的研究来撰写有关该主题的力量和知识。这总是意味着, 不是我找不到合适的词,[而是]我没有弹药。” [7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn7)

When you feel stuck in your creative pursuits, it doesn’t mean that there’s something wrong with you. You haven’t lost your touch or run out of creative juice. It just means you don’t yet have enough raw material to work with. If it feels like the well of inspiration has run dry, it’s because you need a deeper well full of examples, illustrations, stories, statistics, diagrams, analogies, metaphors, photos, mindmaps, conversation notes, quotes—anything that will help you argue for your perspective or fight for a cause you believe in.  
当您觉得自己的创意追求陷入困境时, 这并不意味着您有问题。您并没有失去联系或用尽创意。这只是意味着您还没有足够的原材料可以使用。如果感觉灵感之井已经枯竭, 那是因为你需要一口更深的井, 里面装满了例子、插图、故事、统计数据、图表、类比、隐喻、照片、思维导图、谈话笔记、引语——任何可以帮助你争论的东西为您的观点或为您相信的事业而战。

### Choosing a Notetaking App: The Neural Center of Your Second Brain  
选择笔记应用程序: 第二大脑的神经中枢

The same technology that has fueled an explosion in the volume of information coming our way has also provided the tools to help us manage it.  
推动我们获取的信息量激增的技术也提供了帮助我们管理信息量的工具。

While your Second Brain is made up of all the tools you use to interact with information, including a to-do list, a calendar, email, and reading apps, for example, there is one category of software I recommend as the centerpiece of your Second Brain: a digital notetaking app.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-034) There are plentiful options available, from the free notes app that came preinstalled on your smartphone to third-party software you can download with exactly the features you need.  
虽然您的第二大脑由您用来与信息交互的所有工具组成, 例如待办事项列表、日历、电子邮件和阅读应用程序, 但我推荐一类软件作为您的核心第二大脑: 数字笔记应用程序。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-034) 有很多选项可供选择, 从智能手机上预装的免费笔记 app 到可以下载的第三方软件, 这些软件都具有您需要的功能。

From Microsoft OneNote, Google Keep, and Apple Notes to Notion and Evernote, digital notes apps have four powerful characteristics that make them ideal for building a Second Brain. They are:  
从 Microsoft OneNote、Google Keep 和 Apple Notes 到 Notion 和 Evernote, 数字笔记应用程序具有四个强大的特性, 使其成为构建第二大脑的理想选择。他们是:

*   **Multimedia:** Just like a paper notebook might contain drawings and sketches, quotes and ideas, and even a pasted photo or Post-it, a notes app can store a wide variety of different kinds of content in one place, so you never need to wonder where to put something.  
    多媒体: 就像纸质笔记本可能包含绘图和素描、引语和想法, 甚至是粘贴的照片或便利贴一样, 笔记应用程序可以在一个地方存储各种不同类型的内容, 因此您永远不必怀疑放东西的地方。
*   **Informal:** Notes are inherently messy, so there’s no need for perfect spelling or polished presentation. This makes it as easy and frictionless as possible to jot things down as soon as they occur to you, which is essential to allow nascent ideas to grow.  
    非正式: 笔记本质上是杂乱无章的, 因此不需要完美的拼写或优美的呈现。这样一来, 您就可以尽可能轻松无阻地记下事情, 这对于让新生的想法成长至关重要。
*   **Open-ended:** Taking notes is a continuous process that never really ends, and you don’t always know where it might lead. Unlike more specialized kinds of software that are designed to produce a specific kind of output (such as slide decks, spreadsheets, graphics, or videos), notes are ideal for free-form exploration before you have a goal in mind.  
    开放式: 做笔记是一个持续不断的过程, 永远不会真正结束, 而且您并不总是知道它会通向哪里。与旨在生成特定类型输出 (例如幻灯片、电子表格、图形或视频) 的更专业的软件不同, 笔记是您在确定目标之前进行自由形式探索的理想选择。
*   **Action-oriented:** Unlike a library or research database, personal notes don’t need to be comprehensive or precise. They are designed to help you quickly capture stray thoughts so you can remain focused on the task at hand.  
    以行动为导向: 与图书馆或研究数据库不同, 个人笔记不需要全面或精确。它们旨在帮助您快速捕获杂念, 以便您可以专注于手头的任务。

All four of the above qualities are shared by paper notes, but when we make them digital, we can supercharge these timeless benefits with the incredible capabilities of technology—searching, sharing, backups, editing, linking, syncing between devices, and many others. Digital notes combine the casual artistry of a daily sketchbook with the scientific power of modern software.  
纸质笔记具有上述所有四种品质, 但当我们将它们数字化时, 我们可以利用令人难以置信的技术功能——搜索、共享、备份、编辑、链接、设备间同步等等, 来增强这些永恒的好处。数字笔记将日常速写本的随意艺术与现代软件的科学力量相结合。

Choosing which apps and tools you’ll use is a personal decision, and depends on which mobile device you use, the needs of your job or business, and even your own temperament and taste. The software landscape is dynamic and constantly changing. New apps regularly come out, and existing ones release innovative new features. You can find a free, continually updated guide to choosing your notes app and other Second Brain tools at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources).  
选择使用哪些应用程序和工具是个人决定, 取决于您使用的移动设备、您的工作或业务需求, 甚至您自己的气质和品味。软件环境是动态的并且不断变化的。新的应用程序会定期推出, 而现有的应用程序会发布创新的新功能。您可以在 Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 找到一份免费的、不断更新的指南, 以选择您的笔记应用程序和其他第二大脑工具。

Although you will always use many different software programs to manage information and do your work—from word processors to messaging platforms and project management tools used within your organization—your notes app is uniquely designed to facilitate personal knowledge management.  
尽管您总是会使用许多不同的软件程序来管理信息和完成您的工作——从文字处理器到消息平台和组织内使用的项目管理工具——你的笔记应用程序是专门为促进个人知识管理而设计的。

A good place to start is to look at the apps you already have and perhaps are already using. You can always start now with a basic option and upgrade later as your needs get more sophisticated.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-033)  
一个好的起点是查看您已经拥有并且可能已经在使用的应用程序。您始终可以从一个基本选项开始, 然后在您的需求变得更复杂时升级。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-033)

Most important of all, don’t get caught in the trap of perfectionism: insisting that you have to have the “perfect” app with a precise set of features before you take a single note. It’s not about having the perfect tools—it’s about having a _reliable_ set of tools you can depend on, knowing you can always change them later.  
最重要的是, 不要陷入完美主义的陷阱: 坚持认为您必须拥有具有精确功能集的 “完美” 应用程序, 然后才能做一个笔记。这不是关于拥有完美的工具——而是关于拥有一套您可以依赖的可靠工具, 并且知道您以后可以随时更改它们。

### Remembering, Connecting, Creating: The Three Stages of Personal Knowledge Management  
记忆、联系、创造: 个人知识管理的三个阶段

As people set out on their Second Brain journey, there are three stages of progress I often observe—and even encourage. Those stages are _remembering_, _connecting_, and _creating_. It takes time to fully unlock the value of using digital tools to enhance and extend what our minds are capable of, but there are also distinct benefits at every step along the way.  
当人们踏上他们的第二大脑之旅时, 我经常观察到三个阶段的进展——甚至鼓励。这些阶段是 remembering、connecting 和 creating。完全释放使用数字工具来增强和扩展我们的思维能力的价值需要时间, 但在此过程中的每一步都有明显的好处。

The first way that people tend to use their Second Brain is as a memory aid. They use their digital notes to save facts and ideas that they would have trouble recalling otherwise: takeaways from meetings, quotes from interviews, or the details of a project, for example.  
人们倾向于使用第二大脑的第一种方式是作为记忆辅助工具。他们使用数字笔记来保存他们难以回忆的事实和想法: 例如, 会议要点、采访引述或项目细节。

Camille is the cofounder and lead designer of a start-up in Quebec, Canada. She uses her Second Brain to save excerpts from the many research reports and studies she reads as part of her work designing electric vehicle charging stations for large residential buildings. Most of these reports are published as PDFs, a notoriously inflexible and difficult-to-use format, but by importing the findings most relevant to her work into her notes, she can add as many annotations and comments as she wants.  
Camille 是加拿大魁北克一家初创公司的联合创始人和首席设计师。作为她为大型住宅楼设计电动汽车充电站的工作的一部分, 她使用她的第二大脑保存了她阅读的许多研究报告和研究的摘录。大多数这些报告都以 PDF 格式发布, 这是一种众所周知的不灵活且难以使用的格式, 但通过将与她的工作最相关的发现导入她的笔记, 她可以根据需要添加任意数量的注释和评论。

The second way that people use their Second Brain is to connect ideas together. Their Second Brain evolves from being primarily a _memory_ tool to becoming a _thinking_ tool. A piece of advice from a mentor comes in handy as they encounter a similar situation on a different team. An illuminating metaphor from a book finds its way into a presentation they’re delivering. The ideas they’ve captured begin gravitating toward each other and cross-pollinating.  
人们使用第二大脑的第二种方式是将想法联系在一起。他们的第二大脑从最初的记忆工具演变为思维工具。当他们在不同的团队遇到类似情况时, 来自导师的一条建议会派上用场。一本书中的一个有启发性的比喻进入了他们正在提供的演示文稿中。他们捕捉到的想法开始相互吸引并相互授粉。

Fernando is an oncologist at a world-renowned hospital who uses his Second Brain to organize his patient notes. He summarizes the key points from each patient’s health history with a special focus on how long they’ve had the condition, which treatments they’ve received, and key features of their tumor. Fernando uses his Second Brain to _connect_ what he knows from his training and research to the needs of his patients, to be able to treat them more effectively.  
费尔南多是一家世界知名医院的肿瘤科医生, 他使用他的第二大脑来整理他的病人笔记。他总结了每位患者健康史的要点, 特别关注他们患病的时间、接受的治疗以及肿瘤的主要特征。费尔南多使用他的第二大脑将他从培训和研究中获得的知识与患者的需求联系起来, 以便能够更有效地治疗他们。

Eventually, the third and final way that people use their Second Brain is for creating new things. They realize that they have a lot of knowledge on a subject and decide to turn it into something concrete and shareable. Seeing so much supporting material ready and waiting gives them the courage to put their own ideas out there and have a positive impact on others.  
最终, 人们使用第二大脑的第三种也是最后一种方式是创造新事物。他们意识到他们在某个主题上拥有大量知识, 并决定将其转化为具体且可共享的东西。看到如此多的支持材料准备就绪并等待着, 他们有勇气将自己的想法付诸实践并对他人产生积极影响。

Terrell is a young father of three working a demanding job at a large tech company in Texas. After taking my course, he used his Second Brain to start a YouTube channel where he shares stories and tips on parenting. For example, he’s made videos on how to travel internationally with kids and how to request paternity leave, and shared clips from weekend trips he’s taken with his family.  
Terrell 是三个孩子的年轻父亲, 在德克萨斯州的一家大型科技公司从事一份要求很高的工作。上完我的课程后, 他用他的第二大脑开了一个 YouTube 频道, 在那里他分享育儿故事和技巧。例如, 他制作了有关如何带孩子出国旅行以及如何申请陪产假的视频, 并分享了他与家人周末旅行的片段。

Being able to keep track of all the video ideas and production details outside his head has been crucial in allowing Terrell to balance his side gig with his full-time career, while still having enough time with his kids. He is using his Second Brain to express himself and _create_ the content he wants to see in the world.  
能够在头脑之外跟踪所有视频创意和制作细节对于让 Terrell 平衡他的副业和他的全职工作, 同时仍然有足够的时间陪伴他的孩子至关重要。他正在使用他的第二大脑来表达自己并创造他想在世界上看到的内容。

Each of these individuals has leveraged technology to remember, connect, and create far more effectively than if they had to do it on their own.[8](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn8) They use their Second Brain in ways that complement the current season of their lives. As those seasons change, they will be able to adapt how they use their notes so that they remain relevant and useful.  
这些人中的每一个人都利用技术来记忆、联系和创造, 这比他们必须自己做的要有效得多。 [8](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn8) 他们以补充当前生活季节的方式使用他们的第二大脑。随着这些季节的变化, 他们将能够调整他们使用笔记的方式, 以便它们保持相关性和有用性。

### Introducing The CODE Method: The Four Steps to Remembering What Matters  
介绍 CODE 方法: 记住重要事项的四个步骤

To guide you in the process of creating your own Second Brain, I’ve developed a simple, intuitive four-part method called “CODE”—Capture; Organize; Distill; Express.  
为了指导您创建自己的第二大脑, 我开发了一种简单、直观的四部分方法, 称为 “CODE”——捕获; 组织; 蒸馏; 表达。

These are the steps not only to build your Second Brain in the first place, but also to work with it going forward. Each of these steps represents a timeless principle found throughout humanity’s history, from the earliest cave paintings to the artisan workshops of the Renaissance to the most cutting-edge modern fields. They are flexible and agnostic for any profession, role, or career and for whatever notetaking methods and platforms you prefer. I’m even willing to bet that you’re doing them already in some form, whether you realize it or not.  
这些步骤不仅是建立你的第二大脑的第一步, 也是让它向前发展的步骤。从最早的洞穴壁画到文艺复兴时期的工匠作坊, 再到最前沿的现代领域, 这些步骤中的每一步都代表了贯穿人类历史的永恒原则。它们灵活且不可知, 适用于任何职业、角色或职业, 也适用于您喜欢的任何笔记方法和平台。我什至敢打赌, 无论您是否意识到, 您已经以某种形式在做这些事情。

CODE is a map for navigating the endless streams of information we are now faced with every day. It is a modern approach to creating a commonplace book, adapted to the needs of the Information Age.  
CODE 是一张地图, 用于导航我们现在每天面对的无穷无尽的信息流。这是一种现代的方法来创建一本平凡的书, 适应信息时代的需要。

The same way we have a genetic code that determines our height and eye color, we also have a _creative_ code that is hardwired into our imagination. It shapes how we think and how we interact with the world. It is mirrored in the _software_ code that runs the apps we use to handle information. It’s also been a _secret_ code for most of history—now it’s finally time to reveal how it works.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-032)  
就像我们拥有决定身高和眼睛颜色的遗传密码一样, 我们也拥有根植于我们想象力的创意密码。它塑造了我们的思维方式以及我们与世界互动的方式。它反映在运行我们用来处理信息的应用程序的软件代码中。它也是大部分历史的密码——现在终于要揭示它是如何工作的了。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-032)

Let’s preview each of the four steps of the CODE Method—Capture, Organize, Distill, and Express—and then we’ll dive into the details in the following chapters.  
让我们预览一下 CODE 方法的四个步骤——捕获、组织、提炼和表达——然后我们将在后面的章节中深入探讨细节。

#### Capture: Keep What Resonates 捕获: 保持共鸣

Every time we turn on our smartphone or computer, we are immediately immersed in the flow of juicy content they present. Much of this information is useful and interesting—how-to articles that could make us more productive, podcasts with experts sharing hard-won lessons, or inspiring photos of travel destinations we might want to visit.  
每次我们打开智能手机或电脑时, 我们都会立即沉浸在它们呈现的精彩内容流中。其中大部分信息既有用又有趣——可以提高我们工作效率的操作方法文章、专家分享来之不易的经验教训的播客, 或者我们可能想去的旅行目的地的鼓舞人心的照片。

Here’s the problem: we can’t consume every bit of this information stream. We will quickly be exhausted and overwhelmed if we try. We need to adopt the perspective of a curator, stepping back from the raging river and starting to make intentional decisions about what information we want to fill our minds.  
这就是问题所在: 我们无法消耗此信息流的每一点。如果我们尝试, 我们很快就会精疲力竭和不知所措。我们需要采用策展人的视角, 从汹涌的河流中退后一步, 开始有意识地决定我们想用什么信息来填满我们的脑海。

Like a scientist capturing only the rarest butterflies to take back to the lab, our goal should be to “capture” only the ideas and insights we think are truly noteworthy. Content tends to pile up all around us even without our involvement. There are probably emails filling your inbox, updates popping up in your social media feeds, and notifications proliferating on your smartphone as you’re reading this.  
就像科学家只捕捉最稀有的蝴蝶带回实验室一样, 我们的目标应该是只 “捕捉” 我们认为真正值得注意的想法和见解。即使没有我们的参与, 内容也会堆积在我们周围。当您阅读本文时, 您的收件箱中可能充满了电子邮件, 社交媒体源中弹出更新, 智能手机上的通知激增。

It’s already there, but we tend to capture it haphazardly, at best. You might email yourself a quick note, brainstorm some ideas in a document, or highlight quotes in a book you’re reading, but that information probably remains disconnected and scattered. The insights you uncovered through serious mental effort remain hidden in forgotten folders or drifting in the cloud.  
它已经存在, 但我们最多只能随意捕捉它。您可能会通过电子邮件给自己发送一封简短的便条, 在文档中集思广益, 或者在您正在阅读的书中突出显示引文, 但这些信息可能仍然不连贯且分散。您通过认真的脑力劳动发现的见解仍然隐藏在被遗忘的文件夹中或漂浮在云中。

The solution is to _keep only what resonates_ in a trusted place that you control, and to leave the rest aside.  
解决方案是只保留在您控制的可信赖位置产生共鸣的内容, 而将其余部分放在一边。

When something resonates, it moves you on an intuitive level. Often, the ideas that resonate are the ones that are most unusual, counterintuitive, interesting, or potentially useful. Don’t make it an analytical decision, and don’t worry about why exactly it resonates—just look inside for a feeling of pleasure, curiosity, wonder, or excitement, and let that be your signal for when it’s time to capture a passage, an image, a quote, or a fact.  
当某些东西产生共鸣时, 它会在直觉层面上打动你。通常, 引起共鸣的想法是最不寻常、违反直觉、有趣或可能有用的想法。不要让它成为一个分析性的决定, 也不要担心它到底为什么会引起共鸣——只要看看内心是否有一种愉悦、好奇、惊奇或兴奋的感觉, 让它成为你捕捉一段话的信号、图像、引述或事实。

By training ourselves to notice when something resonates with us, we can improve not only our ability to take better notes, but also our understanding of ourselves and what makes us tick. It is a way of turning up the volume on our intuition so we can hear the wisdom it offers us.  
通过训练自己去注意什么时候能引起我们的共鸣, 我们不仅可以提高记笔记的能力, 还可以提高我们对自己的理解, 以及是什么让我们打勾。这是一种调高我们直觉音量的方法, 这样我们就能听到它为我们提供的智慧。

Adopting the habit of knowledge capture has immediate benefits for our mental health and peace of mind. We can let go of the fear that our memory will fail us at a crucial moment. Instead of jumping at every new headline and notification, we can choose to consume information that adds value to our lives and consciously let go of the rest.  
养成获取知识的习惯对我们的心理健康和内心平静有立竿见影的好处。我们可以不再担心我们的记忆力会在关键时刻失灵。与其跳进每一个新的标题和通知, 我们可以选择消费能为我们的生活增加价值的信息, 并有意识地放弃其他信息。

#### Organize: Save for Actionability 组织: 为可操作性而保存

Once you’ve begun capturing notes with the ideas that resonate with you, you’ll eventually feel the need to organize them.  
一旦你开始用与你产生共鸣的想法来记录笔记, 你最终会觉得有必要组织它们。

It is tempting to try to create a perfect hierarchy of folders up front to contain every possible note you might ever want to capture. Even if it was possible, that approach would be incredibly time-consuming and require way too much effort, pulling you away from what interests you today.  
尝试预先创建一个完美的文件夹层次结构以包含您可能想要捕获的所有可能的笔记是很诱人的。即使有可能, 这种方法也会非常耗时并且需要太多的努力, 让你远离你今天感兴趣的事情。

Most people tend to organize information by subject, like the Dewey decimal system you’ve probably seen at the library. For example, you might find a book under a broad subject category like “Architecture,” “Business,” “History,” or “Geology.”  
大多数人倾向于按主题组织信息, 例如您可能在图书馆见过的杜威十进制系统。例如, 您可能会在 “建筑”、“商业”、“历史” 或“地质学”等广泛学科类别下找到一本书。

When it comes to digital notes, we can use much easier and lighter ways of organizing. Because our priorities and goals can change at a moment’s notice, and probably will, we want to avoid organizing methods that are overly rigid and prescriptive. The best way to organize your notes is to _organize for action_, according to the active projects you are working on right now. Consider new information in terms of its _utility_, asking, “How is this going to help me move forward one of my current projects?”  
当谈到数字笔记时, 我们可以使用更简单、更轻松的组织方式。因为我们的优先事项和目标可能会在一瞬间发生变化, 而且很可能会发生变化, 所以我们希望避免组织过于僵化和规定性的方法。组织笔记的最佳方式是根据您目前正在进行的活动项目来组织行动。从效用的角度考虑新信息, 问 “这将如何帮助我推进我当前的项目之一?”

Surprisingly, when you focus on taking action, the vast amount of information out there gets radically streamlined and simplified. There are relatively few things that are actionable and relevant at any given time, which means you have a clear filter for ignoring everything else.  
令人惊讶的是, 当您专注于采取行动时, 那里的大量信息会从根本上得到精简和简化。在任何给定时间, 可操作和相关的事情相对较少, 这意味着您有一个清晰的过滤器来忽略其他一切。

Organizing for action gives you a sense of tremendous clarity, because you know that everything you’re keeping actually has a purpose. You know that it aligns with your goals and priorities. Instead of organizing being an obstacle to your productivity, it becomes a contributor to it.  
组织行动让你有一种无比清晰的感觉, 因为你知道你所做的一切实际上都是有目的的。您知道它符合您的目标和优先事项。组织不是你生产力的障碍, 而是成为它的贡献者。

#### Distill: Find the Essence 提炼: 找到本质

Once you start capturing ideas in a central place and organizing them for action, you’ll inevitably begin to notice patterns and connections between them.  
一旦你开始在一个中心位置捕捉想法并组织它们以采取行动, 你将不可避免地开始注意到它们之间的模式和联系。

An article you read about gardening will give you an insight into growing your customer base. An offhand testimonial from a client will give you the idea to create a web page with all your client testimonials. A business card will remind you of a fascinating conversation you had with someone who you could reach out to for coffee.  
您阅读的有关园艺的文章将使您深入了解如何扩大客户群。来自客户的临时推荐会让您产生创建一个包含所有客户推荐的网页的想法。名片会让您想起您与某个人进行的精彩对话, 您可以伸手去喝杯咖啡。

The human mind is like a sizzling-hot frying pan of associations—throw a handful of seeds in there and they’ll explode into new ideas like popcorn. Every note is the seed of an idea, reminding you of what you already know and already think about a topic.  
人的头脑就像一个由各种联想组成的滚烫的煎锅——往里面撒一把种子, 它们就会像爆米花一样爆出新的想法。每一个笔记都是一个想法的种子, 提醒你你已经知道和已经思考过的话题。

There is a powerful way to facilitate and speed up this process of rapid association: _distill your notes down to their essence_.  
有一种强大的方法可以促进和加速这种快速联想的过程: 将你的笔记提炼成它们的本质。

Every idea has an “essence”: the heart and soul of what it is trying to communicate. It might take hundreds of pages and thousands of words to fully explain a complex insight, but there is always a way to convey the core message in just a sentence or two.  
每个想法都有一个 “本质”: 它试图传达的内容的核心和灵魂。可能需要数百页和数千字才能完全解释一个复杂的见解, 但总有一种方法可以用一两句话传达核心信息。

Einstein famously summarized his revolutionary new theory of physics with the equation E=mc2. If he can distill his thinking into such an elegant equation, you can surely summarize the main points of any article, book, video, or presentation so that the main point is easy to identify.  
爱因斯坦用方程式 E=mc 2 总结了他革命性的物理学新理论。如果他能将他的思想提炼成这样一个优雅的方程式, 那么你一定可以概括任何文章、书籍、视频或演示文稿的要点, 使要点易于识别。

Why is it so important to be able to easily find the main point of a note? Because in the midst of a busy workday, you won’t have time to review ten pages of notes on a book you read last year—you need to be able to quickly find just the main takeaways.  
为什么能够轻松找到笔记的要点如此重要? 因为在忙碌的工作日中, 您没有时间复习去年读过的一本书的十页笔记——您需要能够快速找到主要内容。

If you’ve highlighted those takeaways in the flow of the reading you were already doing anyway, you’ll be able to remind yourself of what the book contains without having to spend hours rereading it.  
如果你已经在阅读的过程中强调了这些要点, 你就可以提醒自己这本书的内容, 而不必花几个小时重新阅读它。

Every time you take a note, ask yourself, “How can I make this as useful as possible for my future self?” That question will lead you to annotate the words and phrases that explain why you saved a note, what you were thinking, and what exactly caught your attention.  
每次做笔记时, 问问自己:“我怎样才能使它对未来的自己尽可能有用?” 该问题将引导您对单词和短语进行注释, 这些单词和短语可以解释您保存笔记的原因、您的想法以及究竟是什么引起了您的注意。

Your notes will be useless if you can’t decipher them in the future, or if they’re so long that you don’t even try. Think of yourself not just as a _taker_ of notes, but as a _giver_ of notes—you are giving your future self the gift of knowledge that is easy to find and understand.  
如果您将来无法破译笔记, 或者如果它们太长以至于您甚至都不想尝试, 那么您的笔记将毫无用处。不仅要将自己视为记笔记的人, 还要将自己视为记笔记的人——您正在为未来的自己提供易于查找和理解的知识礼物。

#### Express: Show Your Work 表达: 展示你的作品

All the previous steps—capturing, organizing, and distilling—are geared toward one ultimate purpose: sharing your own ideas, your own story, and your own knowledge with others.  
前面所有的步骤——捕捉、组织和提炼——都是为了一个最终目的: 与他人分享你自己的想法、你自己的故事和你自己的知识。

What is the point of knowledge if it doesn’t help anyone or produce anything?[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-031) Whether your goal is to lose weight, get a promotion at work, start a side business, or strengthen your local community, personal knowledge management exists to support taking action—anything else is a distraction.  
如果没有帮助到任何人或产生任何东西, 知识还有什么意义? [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-031) 无论您的目标是减肥、在工作中获得晋升、开展副业, 还是加强您当地的社区, 个人知识管理的存在都是为了支持采取行动——其他任何事情都会让人分心。

A common challenge for people who are curious and love to learn is that we can fall into the habit of continuously force-feeding ourselves more and more information, but never actually take the next step and apply it. We compile tons of research, but never put forward our own proposal. We gather untold business case studies, but never pitch one potential client. We study every piece of relationship advice available, but never ask anyone out on a date.  
对于好奇和热爱学习的人来说, 一个共同的挑战是, 我们可能会养成不断强迫自己输入越来越多信息的习惯, 但从未真正采取下一步行动并加以应用。我们汇集了大量研究, 但从未提出自己的建议。我们收集了数不清的商业案例研究, 但从不推销一个潜在客户。我们研究每条可用的关系建议, 但从不约任何人约会。

It’s so easy to endlessly delay and postpone the experiences that would so enrich our lives. We think we’re not ready. We fear we’re not prepared. We cannot stand the thought that there is one little piece of information we’re missing that, if we had it, would make all the difference.  
无休止地拖延和推迟那些可以丰富我们生活的经历是很容易的。我们认为我们还没有准备好。我们担心我们没有准备好。我们不能容忍这样的想法, 即我们遗漏了一小段信息, 如果我们拥有它, 就会有很大的不同。

I’m here to tell you that that is no way to live your life. Information becomes _knowledge_—personal, embodied, verified—only when we put it to use. You gain confidence in what you know only when you know that it works. Until you do, it’s just a theory.  
我在这里告诉你, 那不是你的生活方式。信息成为知识——个人的、体现的、经过验证的——只有当我们使用它时。只有当你知道它有效时, 你才会对你所知道的有信心。在您这样做之前, 这只是一个理论。

This is why I recommend you shift as much of your time and effort as possible from consuming to creating.[V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-030) We all naturally have a desire to create—to bring to life something good, true, or beautiful.[9](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn9) It’s a part of our essential nature. Creating new things is not only one of the most deeply fulfilling things we can do, it can also have a positive impact on others—by inspiring, entertaining, or educating them.  
这就是为什么我建议您将尽可能多的时间和精力从消费转移到创造上。 [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-030) 我们天生就有创造的愿望——将美好、真实或美丽的事物带入生活。 [9](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch03fn9) 这是我们本质的一部分。创造新事物不仅是 我们能做的最有成就感的事情之一, 它还可以通过启发、娱乐或教育他人对他人产生积极影响。

What should you create? 你应该创造什么?

It depends on your skills, interests, and personality. If you are highly analytical, you could evaluate the many options for camping gear and create a list of recommended products to share with your friends. If you like to teach, you could record your favorite dessert recipe and post it on social media or a blog. If you care about a local cause such as public parks, you could create a plan to lobby the city council for more funding.  
这取决于你的技能、兴趣和个性。如果您具有很强的分析能力, 您可以评估露营装备的众多选择, 并创建一个推荐产品列表与您的朋友分享。如果你喜欢教书, 你可以记录你最喜欢的甜点食谱并将其发布在社交媒体或博客上。如果您关心公园等当地事业, 您可以制定一个计划来游说市议会以获得更多资金。

All these actions—evaluate, share, teach, record, post, and lobby[VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-029)—are synonyms for the act of expression. They all draw on outside sources for raw material, they all involve a practical process of refinement over time, and they all end up making an impact on someone or something that matters to you.  
所有这些行为——评估、分享、教导、记录、发帖和游说 [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-029) ——都是表达行为的同义词。它们都利用外部资源获取原材料, 它们都涉及随着时间的推移进行改进的实际过程, 并且它们最终都会对对你重要的人或事产生影响。

Information is always in flux, and it is always a work in progress. Since nothing is ever truly final, there is no need to wait to get started. You can publish a simple website now, and slowly add additional pages over time. You can send out a draft of a piece of writing now and make revisions later when you have more time. The sooner you begin, the sooner you start on the path of improvement.  
信息总是在不断变化, 而且总是在进行中。因为没有什么是真正最终的, 所以没有必要等待开始。您现在可以发布一个简单的网站, 然后慢慢添加其他页面。你现在可以把一篇文章的草稿发出去, 等你有更多时间再做修改。越早开始, 就越早走上改进之路。

I’ve introduced a lot of new concepts and terms, and I know at this point it can seem a little overwhelming. It may feel like you have to learn and do a lot of new things to be able to build a Second Brain.  
我介绍了很多新概念和术语, 我知道在这一点上它看起来有点不知所措。可能感觉你必须学习和做很多新事物才能建立第二大脑。

Here’s the surprising truth: you are already doing most of the work required.  
这是一个令人惊讶的事实: 您已经完成了大部分所需的工作。

You are already learning new things—you couldn’t stop if you wanted to. You already consume interesting ideas—note the dozens of tabs you likely have open in your browser. You already put in so much effort to keep track of all the information you need for your studies, your job, or your business. All you need is a slightly more intentional, more deliberate way to manage that information, plus a few practical habits to ensure it gets done.  
你已经在学习新事物——如果你想停下来是停不下来的。您已经消费了有趣的想法——注意您可能在浏览器中打开的几十个 of 选项卡。您已经付出了如此多的努力来跟踪学习、工作或业务所需的所有信息。您所需要的只是一种稍微更有目的性、更深思熟虑的方式来管理这些信息, 再加上一些实用的习惯来确保它完成。

In Part Two, I will show you how to use the CODE steps to radically expand your memory, intelligence, and creativity. For each step, I’ll share a set of practical techniques that you can implement today that will begin to yield benefits tomorrow. Techniques that don’t require any advanced technology—only the everyday devices and apps you have in your pocket and on your desk right now.  
在第二部分中, 我将向您展示如何使用 CODE 步骤从根本上扩展您的记忆力、智力和创造力。对于每个步骤, 我将分享一组实用技术, 您今天可以实施这些技术, 明天就会开始产生效益。不需要任何先进技术的技术——只需要您现在口袋里和办公桌上的日常设备和应用程序。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-034-backlink). Many people who follow the CODE methodology continue to use paper for their notes. Many even find that they take _more_ notes on paper once they have a way of capturing those notes digitally and saving them in a secure place. It’s not black-or-white. It’s about choosing the right tool for the job. This book is focused primarily on the potential of digital notes.  
    我 。许多遵循 CODE 方法的人继续使用纸张做笔记。许多人甚至发现, 一旦他们有办法以数字方式捕捉这些笔记并将它们保存在安全的地方, 他们就会在纸上做更多的笔记。它不是非黑即白的。这是关于为工作选择合适的工具。本书主要关注数字笔记的潜力。
2.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-033-backlink). Most notes apps provide ways of exporting your notes in standard formats that can then be imported into other apps. I personally have switched platforms twice (from Microsoft Word to Google Docs, and then later to Evernote) and expect to switch to new platforms regularly in the future as technology advances.  
    二。大多数笔记应用程序都提供以标准格式导出笔记的方法, 然后可以将这些格式导入其他应用程序。我个人已经两次切换平台 (从 Microsoft Word 到 Google Docs, 然后再到 Evernote), 并希望随着技术的进步在未来定期切换到新平台。
3.  [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-032-backlink). In a wonderful coincidence, recent research by neurophysiologists May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology indicates that the human brain remembers information using a “grid code”—a part of the brain involved in spatial reasoning. They speculate that “the grid code could therefore be some sort of metric or coordinate system” that can “uniquely and efficiently represent a lot of information.”  
    三、一个奇妙的巧合是, 挪威科技大学的神经生理学家 May-Britt Moser 和 Edvard Moser 最近的研究表明, 人脑使用 “网格代码” 记住信息——大脑中参与空间推理的部分。他们推测,“网格代码因此可能是某种公制或坐标系”, 可以“独特而有效地表示大量信息”。
4.  [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-031-backlink). The word “productivity” has the same origin as the Latin verb _producere_, which means “to produce.” Which means that at the end of the day, if you can’t point to some kind of output or result you’ve produced, it’s questionable whether you’ve been productive at all.  
    四、 “生产力” 一词与拉丁语动词 producere 同源, 意思是 “生产”。这意味着在一天结束时, 如果你不能指出你产生的某种输出或结果, 那么你是否有生产力就值得怀疑了。
5.  [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-030-backlink). The consumerist attitude toward information—that more is better, that we never have enough, and that what we already have isn’t good enough—is at the heart of many people’s dissatisfaction with how they spend their time online. Instead of trying to find “the best” content, I recommend instead switching your focus to making things, which is far more satisfying.  
    诉。对信息的消费主义态度——越多越好, 我们永远都不够, 我们已经拥有的还不够好——是许多人对他们如何度过在线时间的不满的核心。我建议不要试图找到 “最好的” 内容, 而是将注意力转移到制作东西上, 这样会更令人满意。
6.  [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-029-backlink). Other synonyms for expression include publish, speak, present, perform, produce, write, draw, interpret, critique, or translate.  
    六. 表达的其他同义词包括发布、演讲、展示、表演、制作、写作、绘画、解释、批评或翻译。

Information is food for the brain. It’s no accident that we call new ideas “food for thought.”  
信息是大脑的食物。我们将新想法称为 “深思熟虑” 并非偶然。

It’s clear that we need food and water to survive. What may not be so clear is that we also need information to live: to understand and adapt to our environment; to maintain relationships and cooperate with others; and to make wise decisions that further our interests.  
很明显, 我们需要食物和水才能生存。可能不太清楚的是, 我们还需要信息来生存: 了解和适应我们的环境; 与他人保持关系和合作; 做出有利于我们利益的明智决定。

Information isn’t a luxury—it is the very basis of our survival.  
信息不是奢侈品——它是我们生存的基础。

Just as with the food we put into our bodies, it is our responsibility and right to choose our information diet. It’s up to us to decide what information is good for us, what we want more of and less of, and ultimately, what we do with it. You are what you consume, and that applies just as much to information as to nutrition.  
就像我们放入体内的食物一样, 选择我们的信息饮食是我们的责任和权利。由我们来决定哪些信息对我们有好处, 我们想要更多或更少的信息, 以及最终我们如何处理这些信息。你就是你消费的东西, 这同样适用于信息和营养。

A Second Brain gives us a way to filter the information stream and curate only the very best ideas we encounter in a private, trusted place. Think of it as planting your own “knowledge garden” where you are free to cultivate your ideas and develop your own thinking away from the deafening noise of other people’s opinions.  
第二大脑为我们提供了一种过滤信息流的方法, 并只整理我们在一个私人的、值得信赖的 place 中遇到的最好的想法。把它想象成种植你自己的 “知识花园”, 在那里你可以自由地培养你的想法和发展你自己的思维, 远离其他人意见的震耳欲聋的噪音。

A garden is only as good as its seeds, so we want to start by seeding our knowledge garden with only the most interesting, insightful, useful ideas we can find.  
一座花园的好坏取决于它的种子, 所以我们希望从播种我们的知识花园开始, 只用我们能找到的最有趣、最有洞察力、最有用的想法。

You may already consume a lot of content from many different sources, but perhaps never put much thought into what you do with it afterward. Maybe you are already a diligent organizer, but you’ve fallen into a habit of “digital hoarding” that doesn’t end up enriching your life. Or, if this is all completely new to you, you may be starting at square one.  
您可能已经使用了来自许多不同来源的大量内容, 但可能从未考虑过之后如何处理这些内容。也许你已经是一个勤奋的组织者, 但你已经养成了 “数字囤积” 的习惯, 这并不能丰富你的生活。或者, 如果这对您来说是全新的, 您可能会从第一步开始。

No matter your situation, let’s start at the very beginning—how to use the first step of CODE to begin building your own private collection of knowledge.  
无论您的情况如何, 让我们从头开始——如何使用 CODE 的第一步开始构建您自己的私人知识库。

Taylor Swift is an icon of modern pop and country music and one of the best-selling music artists in history. Her nine chart-topping albums have sold over two hundred million copies worldwide and earned her a long list of awards, including eleven Grammy Awards. Not only does she appear in lists of the greatest singer-songwriters of all time, her influence has transcended music and placed her on such lists as the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100.[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn1)  
泰勒斯威夫特是现代流行音乐和乡村音乐的偶像, 也是历史上最畅销的音乐艺术家之一。她的九张排行榜冠军专辑在全球销量超过 2 亿张, 并为她赢得了一长串奖项, 其中包括 11 项格莱美奖。她不仅出现在有史以来最伟大的创作歌手名单中, 她的影响力已经超越了音乐领域, 使她登上了时代 100 强和福布斯名人 100 强等榜单。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn1)

Over the course of her career, Swift has released five documentary films revealing her creative songwriting process. In all of them, she can be found with her head buried in her phone. As she says: “I disappear into my phone because my phone is where I keep my notes and my phone is where I’m editing.”[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn2) In her notes she can write down (and reread, edit, and riff off) any snippet of lyrics or melodic hook that flickers through her mind. She can take her notes everywhere, access them from anywhere, and send them within seconds to a wide network of producers and collaborators using the same device. Any feedback they send back can go right into her notes as well.  
在她的职业生涯中, 斯威夫特发行了五部纪录片, 展示了她创作歌曲的过程。在所有这些照片中, 都可以看到她把头埋在手机里。正如她所说:“我消失在我的手机里, 因为我的手机是我保存笔记的地方, 我的手机是我编辑的地方。” [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn2) 在她的笔记中, 她可以写下 (并重读、编辑和重复) 她脑海中闪过的任何歌词片段或旋律钩。她可以在任何地方记录笔记, 从任何地方访问它们, 并在几秒钟内将它们发送给使用同一设备的广泛的制作人和合作者网络。他们发回的任何反馈也可以直接记入她的笔记中。

In an interview about how she wrote the smash hit “Blank Space,”[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn3) Swift says, “I’ll be going about my daily life and I’ll think, ‘Wow, so we only have two real options in relationships—it’s going to be forever or it’s going to go down in flames,’ so I’ll jot that down in my notes... I’ll come up with a line that I think is clever like ‘Darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream’ and I just pick them and put them where they fit and construct the bridge out of more lines that come up within the last couple of years... ‘Blank Space’ was the culmination of all my best ones one after the other.”  
在一次关于她如何写出红极一时的 “空白” 的采访中, [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn3) Swift 说,“我将开始我的日常生活, 我会想,‘哇, 所以我们在关系中只有两个真正的选择——它将永远存在, 否则它将在火焰中消失,” 所以我会把它记在笔记中...... 我会想出一句我认为很聪明的台词, 比如 “亲爱的, 我是一个穿着像 daydream', 我只是挑选它们并将它们放在合适的位置, 然后用过去几年中出现的更多线条构建桥梁......'Blank Space' 是我所有最好的一个接一个的高潮。

For Swift, writing songs is not a discrete activity that she can do only at certain times and in certain places. It is a side effect of the way her mind works, spinning off new metaphors and turns of phrase at the most unexpected times: “I’m inspired to write songs at any time of day, when I’m going through something or when the dust has settled and I’m over it. It can be anything. I’ll just be doing dishes or something, or in the middle of an interview, and I could get an idea in my head that just kind of sticks out as, ‘That could be a hook, that could be a pre-chorus, that’s a first line.’” She goes on to explain why it’s so important to her to capture those fleeting thoughts right as they appear: “I kind of have to capitalize on the excitement of me getting that idea and see it all the way through or else I’ll leave it behind and assume it wasn’t good enough.”  
对于斯威夫特来说, 写歌并不是她只能在特定时间和特定地点进行的一项离散活动。这是她思维方式的副作用, 在最意想不到的时候衍生出新的隐喻和措辞:“我在一天中的任何时候都会受到启发去写歌, 当我正在经历某事或尘埃落定, 我已经结束了。它可以是任何东西。我只是在洗碗什么的, 或者在接受采访的过程中, 我脑子里可能会冒出一个想法,‘这可能是一个钩子, 可能是一个预合唱, 这是第一句话。'” 她继续解释为什么在这些转瞬即逝的想法出现时立即捕捉对她来说如此重要:“我有点必须利用我得到那个想法的兴奋, 并一直看到它否则我会把它抛在脑后, 并认为它不够好。”

Even after all her success, even Taylor Swift needs a system to carry her ideas from inception all the way to completion. By integrating her notetaking with her daily life, she’s able to use language and analogies that are rooted in everyday feelings and experiences, forging a powerful connection with her fans who call themselves “Swifties.” Listening to her albums is like following Swift on a journey of self-discovery, each album chronicling what she was experiencing and who she was becoming in each chapter of her life.  
即使在她取得成功之后, 即使是 Taylor Swift 也需要一个系统来将她的想法从开始一直传递到完成。通过将记笔记与日常生活相结合, 她能够使用植根于日常感受和经历的语言和 类比, 与自称为 “Swifties” 的粉丝建立了强有力的联系。听她的专辑就像跟随斯威夫特踏上自我发现的旅程, 每张专辑都记录了她在人生的每一章中所经历的事情以及她正在成为什么样的人。

This story sheds light on how even the world’s most successful and prolific creatives need support systems to pursue their craft. It’s not a matter of having enough raw talent. Talent needs to be channeled and developed in order to become something more than a momentary spark. Actor and comedian Jerry Seinfeld, arguably the most influential comedian of his generation, wrote in his book _Is This Anything?_:  
这个故事阐明了即使是世界上最成功和最多产的创意人员也需要支持系统来追求他们的技艺。这不是拥有足够的原始人才的问题。人才需要得到引导和发展, 才能成为超越瞬间火花的东西。演员兼喜剧演员杰里 · 宋飞, 可以说是他那一代最有影响力的喜剧演员, 在他的书 “这是什么?” 中写道:

> _Whenever I came up with a funny bit, whether it happened on a stage, in a conversation or working it out on my preferred canvas, the big yellow legal pad, I kept it in one of those old-school accordion folders... A lot of people I’ve talked to seemed surprised that I’ve kept all these notes. I don’t understand why they think that. I don’t understand why I’ve kept anything else. What could possibly be of more value?  
> 每当我想出一个有趣的片段, 无论是发生在舞台上、谈话中还是在我喜欢的画布上, 黄色的大便笺簿上, 我都会把它放在那些老式的手风琴文件夹中...... 很多与我交谈过的人似乎对我保留了所有这些笔记感到惊讶。我不明白他们为什么这么想。我不明白为什么我保留了其他东西。什么可能更有价值?_

Think about your favorite athlete, musician, or actor. Behind the scenes of their public persona, there is a process they follow for regularly turning new ideas into creative output. The same goes for inventors, engineers, and effective leaders. Innovation and impact don’t happen by accident or chance. Creativity depends on a _creative process_.  
想想你最喜欢的运动员、音乐家或演员。在他们公众形象的背后, 有一个他们遵循的定期将新想法转化为创意输出的过程。这同样适用于发明家、工程师和有效的领导者。创新和影响不会偶然发生。创造力取决于创造过程。

### Creating a Knowledge Bank: How to Generate Compounding Interest from Your Thoughts  
创建一个知识库: 如何从你的想法中产生复利

In Chapter 2, we looked at the history of commonplace books, kept by intellectuals and writers in previous centuries. For them, the purpose of information was clear: to inform their writing, speaking, and conversation. Knowing how they were going to be putting ideas to use gave them a powerful lens for seeing which ones were worth the trouble of writing down.  
在第 2 章中, 我们回顾了前几个世纪知识分子和作家收藏的普通书籍的历史。对他们来说, 信息的目的很明确: 为他们的写作、口语和对话提供信息。知道他们将如何将想法付诸实践, 这给了他们一个强大的镜头, 让他们看到哪些想法值得费心写下来。

This practice continues among creatives today. Songwriters are known for compiling “hook books” full of lyrics and musical riffs they may want to use in future songs. Software engineers build “code libraries” so useful bits of code are easy to access. Lawyers keep “case files” with details from past cases they might want to refer to in the future. Marketers and advertisers maintain “swipe files” with examples of compelling ads they might want to draw from.  
今天, 这种做法在创意人员中仍在继续。词曲作者以编写充满歌词和音乐重复段的 “hook books” 而闻名, 他们可能想在未来的歌曲中使用。软件工程师构建“代码库”, 以便轻松访问有用的代码。律师保留“案件档案”, 其中包含他们将来可能希望参考的过去案件的详细信息。营销人员和广告商维护“刷卡文件”, 其中包含他们可能想从中提取的引人注目的广告示例。

The challenge for the rest of us is how to apply this same lens to the work we do every day. What kinds of information are worth preserving when we don’t know exactly how we’ll be putting it to use? Our world changes much faster than in previous eras, and most of us don’t have a single creative medium we work in. How can we decide what to save when we have no idea what the future holds?  
我们其他人面临的挑战是如何将同样的镜头应用到我们每天所做的工作中。当我们不确切知道我们将如何使用它们时, 什么样的信息值得保留? 我们的世界变化比以前的时代快得多, 我们大多数人都没有单一的创意媒介来工作。当我们不知道未来会怎样时, 我们如何决定保存什么?

To answer that question, we have to radically expand our definition of “knowledge.”  
要回答这个问题, 我们必须从根本上扩展我们对 “知识” 的定义。

Knowledge isn’t just wise quotations from long-dead Greek philosophers in white togas. It’s not just the teachings found within thick textbooks written by academics with advanced degrees. In the digital world we live in, knowledge most often shows up as “content”—snippets of text, screenshots, bookmarked articles, podcasts, or other kinds of media. This includes the content you gather from outside sources but also the content you create as you compose emails, draw up project plans, brainstorm ideas, and journal your own thoughts.  
知识不仅仅是身穿白色长袍的已故希腊哲学家的睿智名言。这不仅仅是由拥有高级学位的学者编写的厚厚教科书中的教义。在我们生活的数字世界中, 知识通常以 “内容” 的形式出现——文本片段、屏幕截图、带书签的文章、 播客或其他类型的媒体。这包括您从外部来源收集的内容, 也包括您在撰写电子邮件、制定项目计划、集思广益和记录自己的想法时创建的内容。

These aren’t just random artifacts with no value—they are “knowledge assets” that crystallize what you know in concrete form.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-028)  
这些不仅仅是没有价值的随机人工制品——它们是 “知识资产”, 将你所知道的具体形式具体化。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-028)

Knowledge isn’t always something “out there” that you have to go out and find. It’s everywhere, all around you: buried in the emails in your inbox, hidden within files in your documents folder, and waiting on cloud drives. Knowledge capture is about mining the richness of the reading you’re already doing and the life you’re already living.  
知识并不总是你必须出去寻找的 “外面” 的东西。它无处不在, 就在您身边: 隐藏在收件箱的电子邮件中, 隐藏在文档文件夹的文件中, 并等待在云驱动器上。知识获取是关于挖掘你已经阅读的内容和你已经过的生活的丰富性。

Sometimes these assets are quite mundane—the agenda from last year’s financial planning off-site repurposed for next year’s meeting. At other times that knowledge is lofty and grand—your in-depth notes from a book on history that could change how you think about the world. Or anything in between. A knowledge asset is anything that can be used in the future to solve a problem, save time, illuminate a concept, or learn from past experience.  
有时这些资产非常平凡——去年场外财务规划的议程被重新用于明年的会议。在其他时候, 知识是崇高而宏伟的——你从一本历史书中做的深入笔记可能会改变你对世界的看法。或者介于两者之间的任何东西。知识资产是未来可以用来解决问题、节省时间、阐明概念或从过去的经验中学习的任何东西。

Knowledge assets can come from either the external world or your inner thoughts. External knowledge could include:  
知识资产可以来自外部世界, 也可以来自您的内心想法。外部知识可能包括:

*   **Highlights:** Insightful passages from books or articles you read.  
    亮点: 您阅读的书籍或文章中有见地的段落。
*   **Quotes:** Memorable passages from podcasts or audiobooks you listen to.  
    语录: 您收听的播客或有声读物中令人难忘的段落。
*   **Bookmarks and favorites:** Links to interesting content you find on the web or favorited social media posts.  
    书签和收藏夹: 指向您在网络上找到的有趣内容或收藏的社交媒体帖子的链接。
*   **Voice memos:** Clips recorded on your mobile device as “notes to self.”  
    语音备忘录: 在您的移动设备上记录为 “自我笔记” 的剪辑。
*   **Meeting notes:** Notes you take about what was discussed during meetings or phone calls.  
    会议记录: 您对会议或电话中讨论的内容所做的记录。
*   **Images:** Photos or other images that you find inspiring or interesting.  
    图片: 您觉得鼓舞人心或有趣的照片或其他图片。
*   **Takeaways:** Lessons from courses, conferences, or presentations you’ve attended.  
    要点: 您参加过的课程、会议或演讲的经验教训。

Look around you and notice that you already have many of these. It may be disorganized, spread around in different places, and saved in different formats, but it’s there. Just notice that you’ve already spent the effort to create or acquire it. All you need to do is gather it up and plant it as the first seeds in your knowledge garden. Soon I’ll show you how to do that.  
环顾四周, 你会发现你已经拥有了很多这样的东西。它可能杂乱无章, 散布在不同的地方, 并以不同的格式保存, 但它就在那里。请注意, 您已经付出了努力来创建或获得它。您需要做的就是收集它并将其作为知识花园中的第一颗种子播种。很快我会告诉你如何做到这一点。

As you start collecting this material from the outer world, it often sparks new ideas and realizations in your inner world. You can capture those thoughts too! They could include:  
当您开始从外部世界收集这些材料时, 它通常会在您的内心世界中激发出新的想法和认识。您也可以捕捉到这些想法! 它们可能包括:

*   **Stories:** Your favorite anecdotes, whether they happened to you or someone else.  
    故事: 您最喜欢的轶事, 无论是发生在您身上还是发生在其他人身上。
*   **Insights:** The small (and big) realizations you have.  
    见解: 您拥有的小 (和大) 实现。
*   **Memories:** Experiences from your life that you don’t want to forget.  
    回忆: 你不想忘记的生活经历。
*   **Reflections:** Personal thoughts and lessons written in a journal or diary.  
    反思: 写在日记或日记中的个人想法和教训。
*   **Musings:** Random “shower ideas” that pop into your head.  
    沉思: 突然出现在您脑海中的随机 “淋浴想法”。

The meaning of a thought, insight, or memory often isn’t immediately clear. We need to write them down, revisit them, and view them from a different perspective in order to digest what they mean to us. It is exceedingly difficult to do that within the confines of our heads. We need an external medium in which to see our ideas from another vantage point, and writing things down is the most effective and convenient one ever invented.  
思想、洞察力或记忆的含义通常不会立即清晰。我们需要将它们写下来, 重新审视它们, 并从不同的角度来看待它们, 以便消化它们对我们的意义。在我们的头脑范围内做到这一点非常困难。我们需要一种外部媒介来从另一个有利的角度看待我们的想法, 而把事情写下来是有史以来最有效、最方便的发明。

Perhaps you have some hesitation about writing down such personal thoughts in a piece of software rather than a private journal. While it’s always up to you what you choose to note down, remember that your Second Brain is private too. You can share certain notes if you want to, but by default everything inside is for your eyes only.  
也许您对在软件而不是私人日记中写下这样的个人想法有些犹豫。虽然选择记下什么始终取决于您, 但请记住, 您的第二大脑也是私人的。如果你愿意, 你可以分享某些笔记, 但默认情况下, 里面的所有内容都只供你查看。

For now, choose the two to three kinds of content from the two lists above that you already have the most of and already value. Some people favor inner sources of knowledge, some people are biased toward the outer world, but most people are somewhere in between. While you can eventually learn to capture from dozens of different sources, it’s important to start small and get your feet wet before diving into the deep end.  
现在, 从上面的两个列表中选择您已经拥有最多并且已经看重的两到三种内容。有些人偏爱内在的知识来源, 有些人偏向于外部世界, 但大多数人介于两者之间。虽然您最终可以学会从数十种不同的来源进行捕捉, 但重要的是从小处着手, 在深入研究之前先尝试一下。

### What _Not_ to Keep 什么不应该保留

The examples I’ve shared may seem so expansive that you’re wondering if there is anything you _shouldn’t_ keep in your Second Brain. In my experience, there are four kinds of content that aren’t well suited to notes apps:  
我分享的例子可能看起来太广泛了, 以至于你想知道是否有什么东西不应该放在你的第二大脑中。根据我的经验, 有四种内容不太适合笔记应用程序:

*   **Is this sensitive information you’d like to keep secure?** The content you save in your notes is easily accessible from any device, which is great for accessibility but not for security. Information like tax records, government documents, passwords, and health records shouldn’t be saved in your notes.  
    您是否希望确保这些敏感信息的安全? 您保存在笔记中的内容可以从任何设备轻松访问, 这非常适合可访问性, 但不利于安全性。 税务记录、政府文件、密码和健康记录等信息不应保存在您的笔记中。
*   **Is this a special format or file type better handled by a dedicated app?** Although you could save specialized files such as Photoshop files or video footage in your notes, you’ll need a specialized app to open them anyway, so there’s no benefit to keeping them in your notes.  
    这是专用应用程序更好地处理的特殊格式或文件类型吗? 尽管您可以在笔记中保存 Photoshop 文件或视频片段等专用文件, 但无论如何您都需要专门的应用程序才能打开它们, 因此将它们保存在笔记中没有任何好处。
*   **Is this a very large file?** Notes apps are made for short, lightweight bits of text and images, and their performance will often be severely hampered if you try to save large files in them.  
    这是一个非常大的文件吗? Notes 应用程序专为简短、轻量级的文本和图像而设计, 如果您尝试在其中保存大文件, 它们的性能通常会受到严重影响。
*   **Will it need to be collaboratively edited?** Notes apps are perfectly suited for individual, private use, which makes them less than ideal for collaboration. You can share individual notes or even groups of notes with others, but if you need multiple people to be able to collaboratively edit a document in real time, then you’ll need to use a different platform.  
    是否需要协作编辑? Notes 应用程序非常适合个人、私人使用, 这使得它们不太适合协作。您可以与他人共享单个笔记甚至笔记组, 但如果您需要多人实时协作编辑文档, 则需要使用不同的平台。

### Twelve Favorite Problems: A Nobel Prize Winner’s Approach to Capturing  
十二个最喜欢的问题: 一位诺贝尔奖得主的捕捉方法

With the abundance of content all around us, it can be hard to know exactly what is worth preserving. I use an insightful exercise to help people make this decision easier. I call it “Twelve Favorite Problems,” inspired by Nobel Prize–winning physicist Richard Feynman.  
随着我们周围内容的丰富, 可能很难确切知道哪些内容值得保留。我使用一个有见地的练习来帮助人们更容易做出这个决定。我将其称为 “十二个最喜欢的问题”, 其灵感来自诺贝尔物理学奖得主理查德 · 费曼。

Feynman was known for his wide-ranging, eclectic tastes. As a child he already showed a talent for engineering, once building a functioning home alarm system out of spare parts while his parents were out running errands. During his colorful lifetime Feynman spent time in Brazil teaching physics, learned to play the bongo and the conga drums well enough to perform with orchestras, and enthusiastically traveled around the world exploring other cultures.  
费曼以其广泛、兼收并蓄的品味而闻名。孩提时代, 他就表现出了工程学方面的天赋, 有一次在父母外出办事时, 他用备件组装了一个功能正常的家庭警报系统。在他丰富多彩的一生中, 费曼曾在巴西教物理, 学会了演奏邦戈鼓和康茄鼓以与管弦乐队一起演奏, 并热情地周游世界探索其他文化。

Of course, Feynman is best known for his groundbreaking discoveries in theoretical physics and quantum mechanics, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 1965. In his spare time, he also played a pivotal role on the commission that investigated the _Challenger_ space shuttle disaster and published half a dozen books.  
当然, 费曼最著名的是他在理论物理和量子力学方面的开创性发现, 并因此获得了 1965 年的诺贝尔奖。在业余时间, 他还在调查挑战者空间的委员会中发挥了关键作用穿梭灾难并出版了六本书。

How could one person make so many contributions across so many areas? How did he have the time to lead such a full and interesting life while also becoming one of the most recognized scientists of his generation?  
一个人怎么能在这么多领域做出这么多贡献? 他怎么会有时间过着如此充实而有趣的生活, 同时还成为他那一代最受认可的科学家之一?

Feynman revealed his strategy in an interview[4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn4):  
费曼在 [4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn4) 的采访中透露了他的策略:

> _You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, “How did he do it? He must be a genius!”  
> 你必须让一打你最喜欢的问题不断出现在你的脑海中, 尽管它们大体上处于休眠状态。每当你听到或读到一个新技巧或一个新结果时, 针对你的十二个问题中的每一个进行测试, 看看它是否有帮助。每隔一段时间就会有一个打击, 人们会说,“他是怎么做到的? 他一定是个天才!”_

In other words, Feynman’s approach was to maintain a list of a dozen open questions. When a new scientific finding came out, he would test it against each of his questions to see if it shed any new light on the problem. This cross-disciplinary approach allowed him to make connections across seemingly unrelated subjects, while continuing to follow his sense of curiosity.  
换句话说, 费曼的方法是维护一个包含十几个未解决问题的列表。当一项新的科学发现出现时, 他会针对他的每一个问题进行测试, 看它是否能为问题提供新的线索。这种跨学科的方法使他能够在看似无关的主题之间建立联系, 同时继续追随他的好奇心。

As told in _Genius: The Life and Science of Richard Feynman_ by James Gleick,[5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn5) Feynman once took inspiration for his physics from an accident at dinner:  
正如 James Gleick 在 Genius:Richard Feynman 的生活和科学中所述, [5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn5) Feynman 曾从一次晚餐事故中获得物理学灵感:

> _... he was eating in the student cafeteria when someone tossed a dinner plate into the air—a Cornell cafeteria plate with the_ _university seal imprinted on one rim—and in the instant of its flight he experienced what he long afterward considered an epiphany. As the plate spun, it wobbled. Because of the insignia he could see that the spin and the wobble were not quite in synchrony. Yet just in that instant it seemed to him—or was it his physicist’s intuition?—that the two rotations were related._  
> ...... 他在学生食堂吃饭时有人向空中扔了一个餐盘——一个边缘印有 大学印章的康奈尔食堂盘子——在它飞起来的那一刻, 他经历了他很久以后认为的顿悟. 当盘子旋转时, 它摇摆不定。由于徽章, 他可以看出自旋和摆动并不完全同步。然而就在那一刻, 他似乎——或者这是他的物理学家的直觉?——这两个旋转是相关的。

After working the problem out on paper, Feynman discovered a 2-to-1 ratio between the plate’s wobble and spin, a neat relationship that suggested a deeper underlying principle at work.  
在纸上解决了这个问题后, 费曼发现了板块摆动和旋转之间的 2 比 1 的比例, 这种巧妙的关系暗示了更深层的基本原理在起作用。

When a fellow physicist and mentor asked what the use of such an insight was, Feynman responded: “It doesn’t have any importance... I don’t care whether a thing has importance. Isn’t it fun?” He was following his intuition and curiosity. But it did end up having importance, with his research into the equations underlying rotation informing the work that ultimately led to him receiving the Nobel Prize.  
当一位物理学家和导师询问这种洞察力有什么用时, 费曼回答说:“它没有任何重要性...... 我不在乎某件事是否重要。是不是很好玩?” 他在追随自己的直觉和好奇心。但它最终变得很重要, 他对旋转方程的研究为最终导致他获得诺贝尔奖的工作提供了信息。

Feynman’s approach encouraged him to follow his interests wherever they might lead. He posed questions and constantly scanned for solutions to long-standing problems in his reading, conversations, and everyday life. When he found one, he could make a connection that looked to others like a flash of unparalleled brilliance.  
费曼的方法鼓励他随心所欲地追随自己的兴趣。他提出问题并不断审视阅读、谈话和日常生活中长期存在的问题的解决方案。当他找到一个时, 他可以建立一种联系, 在其他人看来就像一道无与伦比的光辉。

Ask yourself, “What are the questions I’ve always been interested in?” This could include grand, sweeping questions like “How can we make society fairer and more equitable?” as well as practical ones like “How can I make it a habit to exercise every day?” It might include questions about relationships, such as “How can I have closer relationships with the people I love?” or productivity, like “How can I spend more of my time doing high-value work?”  
问问自己,“我一直感兴趣的问题是什么?”这可能包括诸如 “我们如何才能使社会更公平、更公平?” 之类的宏大而广泛的问题。以及诸如 “我怎样才能养成每天锻炼的习惯?” 之类的实用问题。它可能包括有关人际关系的问题, 例如 “我怎样才能与我爱的人建立更亲密的关系?” 或生产力, 例如“我怎样才能花更多的时间做高价值的工作?”

Here are more examples of favorite problems from my students:  
以下是我的学生最喜欢的问题的更多示例:

*   How do I live less in the past, and more in the present?  
    如何少活过去, 多活现在?
*   How do I build an investment strategy that is aligned with my mid-term and long-term goals and commitments?  
    我如何制定符合我的中长期目标和承诺的投资策略?
*   What does it look like to move from mindless consumption to mindful creation?  
    从无意识的消费转向有意识的创造是什么样的?
*   How can I go to bed early instead of watching shows after the kids go to bed?  
    孩子睡了以后怎么才能早点睡而不是看节目呢?
*   How can my industry become more ecologically sustainable while remaining profitable?  
    我的行业如何在保持盈利的同时变得更具生态可持续性?
*   How can I work through the fear I have of taking on more responsibility?

    我怎样才能同时加速和放松?
*   How can we make the healthcare system more responsive to people’s needs?  
    我们如何才能使医疗保健系统更好地响应人们的需求?
*   What can I do to make eating healthy easier?  
    我可以做些什么来让健康饮食变得更容易?
*   How can I make decisions with more confidence?  
    我怎样才能更有信心地做出决定?

Notice that some of these questions are abstract, while others are concrete. Some express deep longings, while others are more like spontaneous interests. Many are questions about how to live a better life, while a few are focused on how to succeed professionally. The key to this exercise is to make them _open-ended_ questions that don’t necessarily have a single answer. To find questions that invoke a state of wonder and curiosity about the amazing world we live in.  
请注意, 其中一些问题是抽象的, 而另一些则是具体的。有些表达了深深的渴望, 而另一些则更像是自发的兴趣。许多问题是关于如何过上更好的生活, 而一些问题则集中在如何在职业上取得成功。这个练习的关键是让他们成为开放式的问题, 这些问题不一定只有一个答案。寻找能够唤起对我们生活的神奇世界的惊奇和好奇状态的问题。

The power of your favorite problems is that they tend to stay fairly consistent over time. The exact framing of each question may change, but even as we move between projects, jobs, relationships, and careers, our favorite problems tend to follow us across the years. I recommend asking your family or childhood friends what you were obsessed with as a kid. Those very same interests probably still fire your imagination as an adult. Which means any content you collect related to them will likely be relevant far into the future as well.  
你最喜欢的问题的力量在于它们往往会随着时间的推移保持相当一致。每个问题的确切框架可能会改变, 但即使我们在项目、工作、人际关系和职业之间移动, 我们最喜欢的问题往往会多年来一直跟随我们。我建议问问你的家人或儿时的朋友, 你小时候对什么很着迷。这些完全相同的兴趣可能仍然会激发您成年后的想象力。这意味着您收集的与他们相关的任何内容也可能在遥远的未来也相关。

As a kid, I had a passion for LEGOs, the modular toy blocks beloved by generations of children. My parents noticed that I didn’t play with LEGOs like other kids. Instead I spent my time organizing and reorganizing the pieces. I remember being completely captivated by the problem of how to create order out of the chaos of thousands of pieces of every shape and size. I would invent new organizational schemes—by color, by size, by theme—as I became obsessed with the idea that if I could just find the right system, I would finally be able to build my magnum opus—a LEGO spaceship like the ones I saw in the sci-fi movies I loved.  
小时候, 我对乐高积木情有独钟, 这种模块化积木深受几代孩子的喜爱。我的父母注意到我不像其他孩子那样玩乐高积木。相反, 我花时间组织和重新组织这些作品。我记得当时完全被如何从成千上万的各种形状和大小的碎片中创造秩序的问题所吸引。我会发明新的组织方案——按颜色、按大小、按主题——因为我开始痴迷于这样一个想法, 即如果我能找到合适的系统, 我最终就能建造我的巨著——像那些一样的乐高宇宙飞船我在我喜欢的科幻电影中看过。

That very same question—How can creativity emerge out of chaos?—still drives me to this day. Only now, it’s in the form of organizing digital information instead of LEGOs. Pursuing this question has taught me so many things over the years, across many seasons of my life. The goal isn’t to definitively answer the question once and for all, but to use the question as a North Star for my learning.  
同一个问题——创造力如何从混乱中涌现出来?——直到今天仍然驱使着我。只是现在, 它是以组织数字信息而不是乐高积木的形式出现的。多年来, 在我生命的许多季节中, 追寻这个问题教会了我很多东西。目标不是一劳永逸地明确回答问题, 而是将问题作为我学习的北极星。

Take a moment now to write down some of your own favorite problems. Here are my recommendations to guide you:  
现在花点时间写下您自己最喜欢的一些问题。以下是我的建议来指导您:

*   Ask people close to you what you were obsessed with as a child (often you’ll continue to be fascinated with the same things as an adult).  
    询问您身边的人您小时候对什么着迷 (通常您会像成年人一样继续对同样的事物着迷)。
*   Don’t worry about coming up with exactly twelve (the exact number doesn’t matter, but try to come up with at least a few).  
    不要担心是否恰好有 12 个 (确切的数字并不重要, 但尽量想出至少几个)。
*   Don’t worry about getting the list perfect (this is just a first pass, and it will always be evolving).  
    不要担心如何让列表变得完美 (这只是第一步, 它会一直在发展)。
*   Phrase them as open-ended questions that could have multiple answers (in contrast to “yes/no” questions with only one answer).  
    将它们表述为可以有多个答案的开放式问题 (与只有一个答案的“是 / 否” 问题相反)。

Use your list of favorite problems to make decisions about what to capture: anything potentially relevant to answering them. Use one of the capture tools I recommend later in this chapter, or in the Second Brain Resource Guide at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources).  
使用您最喜欢的问题列表来决定要捕获的内容: 与回答这些问题可能相关的任何内容。使用我在本章后面或在 Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 上的第二脑资源指南中推荐的捕获工具之一。

### Capture Criteria: How to Avoid Keeping Too Much (or Too Little)  
捕获标准: 如何避免保存过多 (或过少)

Once you have identified the kinds of questions you want your Second Brain to answer, it’s time to choose specifically which pieces of information will be most useful.  
一旦你确定了你希望第二大脑回答的问题类型, 就该具体选择哪些信息最有用了。

Imagine you come across a blog post during your web browsing that details how a marketing expert you respect runs her campaigns. You’re hooked: this is the kind of material you’ve been looking for! Finally, the master reveals her secrets!  
想象一下, 您在浏览网页时看到一篇博文, 其中详细介绍了您尊敬的营销专家如何开展营销活动。你上瘾了: 这就是你一直在寻找的那种材料! 终于, 大师揭开了她的秘密!

Your first instinct might be to save the article in its entirety. It’s high-quality information, so why not preserve all of it? The problem is, it’s an in-depth how-to article that is thousands of words long. Even if you spend the twenty or thirty minutes it would take to consume it now, in the future you’ll just have to spend all that time reading it again, since you’ll have forgotten most of the details. You also don’t want to just bookmark the link and save it to read later, because then you won’t know what it contains in the first place!  
您的第一直觉可能是完整保存文章。这是高质量的信息, 为什么不保留所有信息呢? 问题是, 这是一篇长达数千字的深度指导文章。即使你现在花 20 或 30 分钟来读完它, 将来你也只需要花所有的时间再读一遍, 因为你会忘记大部分细节。您也不想只为链接添加书签并保存它以供日后阅读, 因为那样您一开始就不知道它包含什么!

This is where most people get stuck. They either dive straight into the first piece of content they see, read it voraciously, but quickly forget all the details, or they open dozens of tabs in their web browser and feel a pang of guilt at all those interesting resources they haven’t been able to get to.  
这是大多数人卡住的地方。他们要么直接进入他们看到的第一段内容, 如饥似渴地阅读, 但很快就忘记了所有细节, 要么他们在网络浏览器中打开了几十个选项卡, 并对所有这些他们没有接触过的有趣资源感到内疚能够到达。

There is a way out of this situation. It starts with realizing that in any piece of content, _the value is not evenly distributed_. There are always certain parts that are especially interesting, helpful, or valuable to you. When you realize this, the answer is obvious. You can extract only the most salient, relevant, rich material and save it as a succinct note.  
有办法摆脱这种情况。首先要意识到在任何内容中, 价值都不是均匀分布的。总会有某些部分对您特别有趣、有帮助或有价值。当你意识到这一点时, 答案就很明显了。您可以仅提取最突出、最相关、最丰富的材料并将其保存为简洁的注释。

Don’t save entire chapters of a book—save only select passages. Don’t save complete transcripts of interviews—save a few of the best quotes. Don’t save entire websites—save a few screenshots of the sections that are most interesting. The best curators are picky about what they allow into their collections, and you should be too. With a notes app, you can always save links back to the original content if you need to review your sources or want to dive deeper into the details in the future.  
不要保存一本书的整个章节——只保存选定的段落。不要保存完整的访谈记录——保存一些最好的引述。不要保存整个网站——保存一些最有趣的部分的屏幕截图。最好的策展人对他们允许收藏的东西很挑剔, 你也应该如此。使用笔记应用程序, 如果您需要查看来源或希望在未来更深入地了解细节, 您可以随时将链接保存回原始内容。

The biggest pitfall I see people falling into once they begin capturing digital notes is saving too much. If you try to save every piece of material you come across, you run the risk of inundating your future self with tons of irrelevant information. At that point, your Second Brain will be no better than scrolling through social media.  
我看到人们一旦开始记录数字笔记就会陷入的最大陷阱是节省太多。如果你试图保存你遇到的每一块材料, 你就有可能让未来的自己被大量无关信息淹没。到那时, 您的第二大脑将不会比滚动浏览社交媒体更好。

This is why it’s so important to take on a Curator’s Perspective—that we are the judges, editors, and interpreters of the information we choose to let into our lives. Thinking like a curator means taking charge of your own information stream, instead of just letting it wash over you. The more economical you can be with the material you capture in the first place, the less time and effort your future self will have to spend organizing, distilling, and expressing it.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-027)  
这就是为什么采用策展人的视角如此重要——我们是我们选择让进入我们生活的信息的法官、编辑和解释者。像策展人一样思考意味着掌控自己的信息流, 而不是让它冲刷你。最初捕获的材料越经济, 未来的自己花在组织、提炼和表达上的时间和精力就越少。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-027)

Here are four criteria I suggest to help you decide exactly which nuggets of knowledge are worth keeping:  
以下是我建议的四个标准, 可帮助您准确决定哪些知识块值得保留:

#### Capture Criteria #1: Does It Inspire Me?  
捕获标准 #1: 它能激发我的灵感吗?

Inspiration is one of the most rare and precious experiences in life. It is the essential fuel for doing your best work, yet it’s impossible to call up inspiration on demand. You can Google the answer to a question, but you can’t Google a feeling.  
灵感是人生中最难得、最宝贵的经历之一。它是完成最佳工作的基本燃料, 但不可能按需唤起灵感。你可以谷歌问题的答案, 但你不能谷歌一种感觉。

There is a way to evoke a sense of inspiration more regularly: keep a collection of inspiring quotes, photos, ideas, and stories. Any time you need a break, a new perspective, or a dash of motivation, you can look through it and see what sparks your imagination.  
有一种方法可以更经常地唤起灵感: 收集鼓舞人心的名言、照片、想法和故事。任何时候您需要休息、新视角或一点点动力时, 您都可以浏览它, 看看是什么激发了您的想象力。

For example, I keep a folder full of customer testimonials I’ve received over the years. Any time I think what I’m doing doesn’t matter or isn’t good enough, all I have to do is open up that folder and my perspective is completely shifted.  
例如, 我保留了一个文件夹, 里面装满了我多年来收到的客户评价。任何时候我认为我在做什么并不重要或不够好, 我所要做的就是打开那个文件夹, 我的观点就会完全改变。

#### Capture Criteria #2: Is It Useful?  
捕获标准 #2: 有用吗?

Carpenters are known for keeping odds and ends in a corner of their workshop—a variety of nails and washers, scraps of lumber cut off from larger planks, and random bits of metal and wood. It costs nothing to keep these “offcuts” around, and surprisingly often they end up being the crucial missing piece in a future project.  
众所周知, 木匠会在车间的一个角落里存放杂物——各种钉子和垫圈、从大木板上切下的木材碎片, 以及随意的金属和木头碎片。保留这些 “边角料” 不需要花费任何成本, 而且令人惊讶的是, 它们往往最终成为未来项目中关键的缺失部分。

Sometimes you come across a piece of information that isn’t necessarily inspiring, but you know it might come in handy in the future. A statistic, a reference, a research finding, or a helpful diagram—these are the equivalents of the spare parts a carpenter might keep around their workshop.  
有时您会遇到一些不一定鼓舞人心的信息, 但您知道它将来可能会派上用场。统计数据、参考资料、研究发现或有用的图表——这些等同于木匠可能在车间周围放置的备件。

For example, I keep a folder full of stock photos, graphics, and drawings I find both online and offline. Any time I need an image for a slide deck, or a web page, or to spark new ideas, I have a plentiful supply of imagery I’ve already found compelling ready and waiting.  
例如, 我保留了一个文件夹, 里面装满了我在网上和线下找到的库存照片、图形和绘图。任何时候我需要用于 幻灯片或网页的图像, 或激发新想法时, 我都有大量图像可供使用, 我已经准备好等待它们了。

#### Capture Criteria #3: Is It Personal?  
捕获标准 #3: 它是个人的吗?

One of the most valuable kinds of information to keep is personal information—your own thoughts, reflections, memories, and mementos. Like the age-old practice of journaling or keeping a diary, we can use notetaking to document our lives and better understand how we became who we are.  
要保留的最有价值的信息之一是个人信息——您自己的想法、想法、记忆和纪念品。就像记录日志或写日记的古老做法一样, 我们可以使用笔记记录我们的生活并更好地了解我们如何成为现在的自己。

No one else has access to the wisdom you’ve personally gained from a lifetime of conversations, mistakes, victories, and lessons learned. No one else values the small moments of your days quite like you do.  
没有其他人能够获得您个人从一生的对话、错误、胜利和经验教训中获得的智慧。没有人像您一样珍视您生活中的每一刻。

I often save screenshots of text messages sent between my family and friends. The small moments of warmth and humor that take place in these threads are precious to me, since I can’t always be with them in person. It takes mere moments, and I love knowing that I’ll forever have memories from my conversations with the people closest to me.  
我经常保存家人和朋友之间发送的短信的屏幕截图。这些线程中发生的温暖和幽默的小时刻对我来说很珍贵, 因为我不能总是和他们在一起。这只需片刻, 我很高兴知道我将永远记住与最亲近的人的谈话。

#### Capture Criteria #4: Is It Surprising?  
捕获标准 #4: 令人惊讶吗?

I’ve often noticed that many of the notes people take are of ideas they already know, already agree with, or could have guessed. We have a natural bias as humans to seek evidence that confirms what we already believe, a well-studied phenomenon known as “confirmation bias.”[6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn6)  
我经常注意到人们所做的许多笔记都是他们已经知道、已经同意或可能已经猜到的想法。作为人类, 我们有一种天生的偏见, 即寻求证据来证实我们已经相信的事情, 这种经过充分研究的现象被称为 “确认偏见”。 [6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn6)

That isn’t what a Second Brain is for. The renowned information theorist Claude Shannon, whose discoveries paved the way for modern technology, had a simple definition for “information”: that which surprises you.[7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn7) If you’re not surprised, then you already knew it at some level, so why take note of it? Surprise is an excellent barometer for information that doesn’t fit neatly into our existing understanding, which means it has the potential to change how we think.  
这不是第二大脑的目的。著名的信息理论家克劳德 · 香农 (Claude Shannon) 的发现为现代技术铺平了道路, 他对 “信息” 有一个简单的定义: 让您感到惊讶的东西。 [7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn7) 如果你不感到惊讶, 那么你在某种程度上已经知道它 , 那么为什么要注意它呢? 对于与我们现有理解不完全吻合的信息, 惊喜是一个很好的晴雨表, 这意味着它有可能改变我们的思维方式。

Sometimes you come across an idea that is neither inspiring, personal, nor obviously useful, but there is something surprising about it. You may not be able to put your finger on why, but it conflicts with your existing point of view in a way that makes your brain perk up and pay attention. Those are the ideas you should capture.  
有时, 您会遇到一个既不鼓舞人心、既不个人化, 也不明显有用的想法, 但它有一些令人惊讶的地方。你可能无法理解为什么, 但它与你现有的观点相冲突, 会让你的大脑振作起来并集中注意力。这些是你应该捕捉的想法。

Your Second Brain shouldn’t be just another way of confirming what you already know. We are already surrounded by algorithms that feed us only what we already believe and social networks that continually reinforce what we already think.  
你的第二大脑不应该只是确认你已经知道的东西的另一种方式。我们已经被只为我们提供我们已经相信的东西的算法和不断强化我们已经思考的社交网络所包围。

Our ability to capture ideas from anywhere takes us in a different direction: By saving ideas that may contradict each other and don’t necessarily support what we already believe, we can train ourselves to take in information from different sources instead of immediately jumping to conclusions. By playing with ideas—bending and stretching and remixing them—we become less attached to the way they were originally presented and can borrow certain aspects or elements to use in our own work.  
我们从任何地方捕捉想法的能力将我们带向了不同的方向: 通过保存可能相互矛盾且不一定支持我们已经相信的想法, 我们可以训练自己从不同来源获取信息, 而不是立即得出结论. 通过玩弄想法——弯曲、拉伸和重新混合它们——我们不再那么执着于它们最初呈现的方式, 并且可以借用某些方面或元素用于我们自己的工作中。

If what you’re capturing doesn’t change your mind, then what’s the point?  
如果你捕捉到的东西没有改变你的想法, 那又有什么意义呢?

### Ultimately, Capture What Resonates  
最终, 捕捉共鸣

I’ve given you specific criteria to help you decide what is worth capturing, but if you take away one thing from this chapter, it should be to keep what resonates.  
我已经给了你具体的标准来帮助你决定什么是值得捕捉的, 但如果你从本章中拿走一件事, 那就应该是保持共鸣。

Here’s why: making decisions analytically, with a checklist, is taxing and stressful. It is the kind of thinking that demands the most energy. When you use up too much energy taking notes, you have little left over for the subsequent steps that add far more value: making connections, imagining possibilities, formulating theories, and creating new ideas of your own. Not to mention, if you make reading and learning into unpleasant experiences, over time you’re going to find yourself doing less and less of them. The secret to making reading a habit is to make it effortless and enjoyable.  
原因如下: 使用清单进行分析性决策既费力又压力大。这是最需要能量的思维方式。当你用了太多的精力做笔记时, 你就剩下 little 用于后续步骤, 这些步骤会增加更多的价值: 建立联系、想象可能性、形成理论和创造你自己的新想法。更不用说, 如果你把阅读和学习变成不愉快的经历, 随着时间的推移, 你会发现自己做的事情越来越少。养成阅读习惯的秘诀在于让它轻松愉快。

As you consume a piece of content, listen for an internal feeling of being moved or surprised by the idea you’re taking in. This special feeling of “resonance”—like an echo in your soul—is your intuition telling you that something is literally “noteworthy.” You don’t need to figure out exactly why it resonates. Just look for the signs: your eyes might widen slightly, your heart may skip a beat, your throat may go slightly dry, and your sense of time might subtly slow down as the world around you fades away. These are clues that it’s time to hit “save.”  
当你消费一段内容时, 倾听一种内心的感觉, 即被你正在接受的想法所感动或惊讶。这种特殊的 “共鸣” 感觉——就像你灵魂中的回声——是你的直觉告诉你某事是字面意思是 “值得注意的”。你不需要弄清楚它为什么会引起共鸣。只需寻找迹象: 您的眼睛可能会稍微睁大, 您的心跳可能会停止跳动, 您的喉咙可能会稍微干燥, 随着您周围的世界逐渐消失, 您的时间感可能会微妙地减慢。这些线索表明是时候点击“保存” 了。

We know from neuroscientific research that “emotions organize—rather than disrupt—rational thinking.”[8](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn8) When something resonates with us, it is our emotion-based, intuitive mind telling us it is interesting before our logical mind can explain why. I often find that a piece of content resonates with me in ways I can’t fully explain in the moment, and its true potential only becomes clear later on.  
我们从神经科学研究中得知,“情绪组织——而不是破坏——理性思维。” [8](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn8) 当某事与我们产生共鸣时, 是我们基于情感的直觉告诉我们这很有趣, 然后我们的逻辑思维才能解释原因。我经常发现一段内容以我当时无法完全解释的方式引起我的共鸣, 而它的真正潜力只有在以后才会变得清晰。

There’s scientific evidence that our intuition knows what it’s doing. From the book _Designing for Behavior Change:_[9](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn9)  
有科学证据表明我们的直觉知道它在做什么。摘自《行为改变设计》一书: [9](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn9)

> _Participants in a famous study were given four biased decks of cards—some that would win them money, and some that would cause them to lose. When they started the game, they didn’t know that the decks were biased. As they played the game, though, people’s bodies started showing signs of physical “stress” when their conscious minds were about to use a money-losing deck. The stress was an automatic response that occurred because the_ _intuitive mind realized something was wrong—long before the conscious mind realized anything was amiss._  
> 在一项著名的研究中, 参与者得到了四副有偏见的纸牌——其中一些会让他们赢钱, 而另一些会让他们输钱。当他们开始游戏时, 他们并不知道套牌是有偏见的。然而, 当他们玩这个游戏时, 当他们有意识的头脑即将使用一副亏钱的套牌时, 他们的身体开始表现出身体 “压力” 的迹象。压力是一种自动反应, 因为 intuitive 头脑意识到出了点问题——远在有意识的头脑意识到任何事情不对劲之前。

The authors’ conclusion: “Our intuitive mind learns, and responds, even without our conscious awareness.”  
作者的结论是:“即使没有我们的意识, 我们的直觉思维也会学习和做出反应。”

If you ignore that inner voice of intuition, over time it will slowly quiet down and fade away. If you practice listening to what it is telling you, the inner voice will grow stronger. You’ll start to hear it in all kinds of situations. It will guide you in what choices to make and which opportunities to pursue. It will warn you away from people and situations that aren’t right for you. It will speak up and take a stand for your convictions even when you’re afraid.  
如果你忽视内心直觉的声音, 随着时间的推移, 它会慢慢平静下来并消失。如果你练习倾听它告诉你的内容, 内在的声音就会变得更强。你会开始在各种情况下听到它。它将指导您做出哪些选择以及追求哪些机会。它会警告您远离不适合您的人和情况。即使您害怕, 它也会大声说出来并坚持您的信念。

I can’t think of anything more important for your creative life—and your life in general—than learning to listen to the voice of intuition inside. It is the source of your imagination, your confidence, and your spontaneity. You can intentionally train yourself to hear that voice of intuition every day by taking note of what it tells you.  
我想不出还有什么比学习倾听内心直觉的声音对你的创造性生活——乃至你的生活——更重要的了。它是你想象力、自信和自发性的源泉。你可以通过记下它告诉你的内容, 有意识地训练自己每天听到直觉的声音。

Besides capturing what personally resonates with you, there are a couple other kinds of details that are generally useful to save in your notes. It’s a good idea to capture key information about the source of a note, such as the original web page address, the title of the piece, the author or publisher, and the date it was published.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-026) Many capture tools are even able to identify and save this information automatically. Also, it’s often helpful to capture chapter titles, headings, and bullet-point lists, since they add structure to your notes and represent distillation already performed by the author on your behalf.  
除了捕捉你个人的共鸣之外, 还有一些其他类型的细节通常对保存在你的笔记中很有用。捕获有关笔记来源的关键信息是个好主意, 例如原始网页地址、文章标题、作者或出版商以及出版日期。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-026) 很多抓包工具甚至可以自动识别并保存这些信息。此外, 捕获章节标题、标题和要点列表通常很有帮助, 因为它们可以为您的笔记添加结构并代表作者已经代表您进行的提炼。

### Beyond Your Notetaking App: Choosing Capture Tools  
Beyond Your Notetaking App: 选择捕捉工具

Now that you know what kinds of material to save in your Second Brain, it’s time to get into the nitty-gritty: How does capturing work exactly?  
现在您已经知道要在您的第二大脑中保存哪些类型的材料, 是时候深入了解细节了: 捕捉究竟是如何工作的?

Let’s say while reading that in-depth marketing article, you decide a specific piece of advice is highly relevant to your own plans. Most notetaking apps (introduced in Chapter 2 and covered in detail in the Second Brain Resource Guide at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources)) have built-in features that allow you to capture excerpts from outside sources, and you can always simply cut and paste text directly into a new note. There is also an array of more specialized “capture tools” that are designed to make capturing content in digital form easy and even fun.  
假设在阅读那篇深度营销文章时, 您认为某条特定建议与您自己的计划高度相关。大多数笔记应用程序 (在第 2 章中介绍并在 Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 的第二大脑资源指南中详细介绍) 都具有内置功能, 允许您从外部来源捕捉摘录, 并且您始终可以直接剪切和粘贴文本进入一个新的笔记。还有一系列更专业的“捕获工具”, 旨在使捕获数字形式的内容变得简单甚至有趣。

The most common options include: 最常见的选项包括:

*   Ebook apps, which often allow you to export your highlights or annotations all at once.  
    电子书应用程序, 通常允许您一次导出所有亮点或注释。
*   Read later apps that allow you to bookmark content you find online for later reading (or in the case of podcasts or videos, listening or watching).  
    Read later 应用程序允许您为在线找到的内容添加书签以供以后阅读 (或者在播客或视频的情况下, 收听或观看)。
*   Basic notes apps that often come preinstalled on mobile devices and are designed for easily capturing short snippets of text.  
    基本笔记应用程序通常预装在移动设备上, 旨在轻松捕获简短的文本片段。
*   Social media apps, which usually allow you to “favorite” content and export it to a notes app.  
    社交媒体应用程序, 通常允许您 “收藏” 内容并将其导出到笔记应用程序。
*   Web clippers, which allow you to save parts of web pages (often included as a built-in feature of notes apps).  
    Web 剪辑器, 允许您保存部分网页 (通常作为笔记应用程序的内置功能包含在内)。
*   Audio/voice transcription apps that create text transcripts from spoken words.  
    从口语创建文本转录的音频 / 语音转录应用程序。
*   Other third-party services, integrations, and plug-ins that automate the process of exporting content from one app to another.  
    自动将内容从一个应用程序导出到另一个应用程序的其他第三方服务、集成和插件。

Some of these tools are free, and others charge a small fee. Some are completely automatic, working silently in the background (for example, to automatically sync your ebook highlights with a notes app), while others require a bit of manual effort (such as taking photos of paper notebooks to save them digitally).[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-025) But in any case, the act of capture takes only moments—to hit share, export, or save—and voilà, you’ve preserved the best parts of whatever you’re consuming in your Second Brain.  
其中一些工具是免费的, 而另一些则收取少量费用。有些是完全自动的, 在后台静默工作 (例如, 自动将电子书亮点与笔记应用程序同步), 而另一些则需要一些手动操作 (例如拍摄纸质笔记本的照片以数字方式保存)。 [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-025) 但无论如何, 捕捉的动作只需要片刻——点击分享、导出或保存——瞧, 你已经在你的第二大脑中保留了你正在消费的任何东西的最好部分。

Make no mistake: you will continue to use many kinds of software to manage information—such as computer folders, cloud storage drives, and various platforms for sharing and collaborating on documents. Think of your capture tools as your extended nervous system, reaching out into the world to allow you to sense your surroundings. No matter how many different kinds of software you use, don’t leave all the knowledge they contain scattered across dozens of places you’ll never think to look. Make sure your best findings get routed back to your notes app where you can put them all together and act on them.  
毫无疑问: 您将继续使用多种软件来管理信息, 例如计算机文件夹、云存储驱动器以及用于共享和协作处理文档的各种平台。将您的捕获工具想象成您的扩展神经系统, 伸入世界以让您感知周围的环境。 无论你使用多少种不同的软件, 都不要把它们包含的所有知识分散在几十个你永远不会想去看看的地方。确保将您的最佳发现路由回您的笔记应用程序, 您可以将它们放在一起并根据它们采取行动。

Here are some of the most popular ways of using capture tools to save content you come across:  
以下是使用捕获工具保存您遇到的内容的一些最流行的方法:

*   **Capturing passages from ebooks:** Most ebook apps make it very easy to highlight passages as you read. On Amazon Kindle, you can simply drag your finger across a sentence or paragraph you like to add a highlight. Then use the share menu to export all your highlights from the entire book all at once straight to your digital notes. You can also add comments right alongside the text as you read, which will help you remember what you found interesting about a passage.  
    从电子书中捕捉段落: 大多数电子书应用程序都可以在您阅读时轻松突出显示段落。在 Amazon Kindle 上, 您只需将手指拖过您喜欢的句子或段落即可添加高亮显示。然后使用共享菜单将整本书中的所有亮点一次性全部直接导出到您的数字笔记中。您还可以在阅读时在文本旁边添加评论, 这将帮助您记住您对段落感兴趣的地方。
*   **Capturing excerpts from online articles or web pages:** When you come across an online article or blog post you want to read, save it to a “read later” app, which is like a digital magazine rack of everything you want to read (or watch or listen to) at some point. Whenever you have some free time (such as on breaks or in the evening after work), scroll through the articles you’ve saved and pick one to read. You can make highlights, just as with ebooks, and they can also be automatically exported to your notes app using a third-party platform.  
    从在线文章或网页中摘录: 当您遇到想要阅读的在线文章或博客文章时, 将其保存到 “稍后阅读” 应用程序中, 它就像一个数字杂志架, 包含您想要阅读 (或观看) 的所有内容或听)在某些时候。每当您有空闲时间 (例如休息时间或下班后的晚上) 时, 滚动浏览您保存的文章并选择一篇阅读。您可以制作高亮显示, 就像电子书一样, 它们也可以使用第三方平台自动导出到您的笔记应用程序。
*   **Capturing quotes from podcasts:** Many podcast player apps allow you to bookmark or “clip” segments of episodes as you’re listening to them. Some of them will even transcribe the audio into text, so you can export and search it within your notes.  
    从播客中捕捉引述: 许多播客播放器应用程序允许您在收听时为剧集片段添加书签或 “剪辑”。其中一些甚至会将音频转录成文本, 因此您可以导出并在笔记中搜索。
*   **Capturing voice memos:** Use a voice memo app that allows you to press a button, speak directly into your smartphone, and have every word transcribed into text and exported to your notes.  
    捕获语音备忘录: 使用语音备忘录应用程序, 您只需按下一个按钮, 直接对着您的智能手机说话, 然后将每个单词转录成文本并导出到您的笔记中。
*   **Capturing parts of YouTube videos:** This is a little-known feature, but almost every YouTube video is accompanied by an automatically generated transcript. Just click the “Open transcript” button and a window will open. From there, you can copy and paste excerpts to your notes.  
    Capturing parts of YouTube videos: 这是一个鲜为人知的功能, 但几乎每个 YouTube 视频都附有自动生成的文字记录。只需单击 “打开成绩单” 按钮, 就会打开一个窗口。从那里, 您可以将摘录复制并粘贴到您的笔记中。
*   **Capturing excerpts from emails:** Most popular notes apps include a feature that allows you to forward any email to a special address, and the full text of that email (including any attachments) will be added to your notes.  
    从电子邮件中捕获摘录: 大多数流行的笔记应用程序都包含一项功能, 允许您将任何电子邮件转发到一个特殊地址, 并且该电子邮件的全文 (包括任何附件) 将添加到您的笔记中。
*   **Capturing content from other apps:** You might edit photos in a photos app, or make sketches in a drawing app, or like posts in a social media app. As long as that app has a “share” button or allows for copy-and-paste, you can save whatever you’ve created directly to your notes for safekeeping.  
    从其他应用程序捕获内容: 您可以在照片应用程序中编辑照片, 或在绘图应用程序中绘制草图, 或在社交媒体应用程序中点赞帖子。只要该应用程序具有 “共享” 按钮或允许复制和粘贴, 您就可以将您创建的任何内容直接保存到您的笔记中以便妥善保管。

### The Surprising Benefits of Externalizing Our Thoughts  
将我们的思想外化的惊人好处

Often ideas occur to us at the most random times—during our commute, while watching TV, when we’re playing with our kids, or in the shower.  
我们经常会在最随机的时间产生想法——在我们上下班途中, 在看电视时, 在我们和孩子玩耍时, 或者在淋浴时。

Your Second Brain gives you a place to corral the jumble of thoughts tumbling through your head and park them in a waiting area for safekeeping. Not only does this allow you to preserve them for the long term; there are multiple other profound benefits that come from the simple act of writing something down.  
您的第二大脑为您提供了一个地方, 可以将头脑中翻滚的杂乱思想集中起来, 并将它们存放在等候区以备妥善保管。这不仅可以让您长期保存它们; 写下一些东西这一简单的行为还有其他许多深远的好处。

First, you are much more likely to remember information you’ve written down in your own words. Known as the “Generation Effect,”[10](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn10) researchers have found that when people actively generate a series of words, such as by speaking or writing, more parts of their brain are activated when compared to simply reading the same words. Writing things down is a way of “rehearsing” those ideas, like practicing a dance routine or shooting hoops, which makes them far more likely to stick.  
首先, 你更有可能记住你用自己的话写下的信息。被称为 “生成效应” 的 [10](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn10) 研究人员发现, 当人们主动生成一系列单词时, 例如通过说或写, 与简单地阅读相同的单词相比, 他们大脑的更多部分会被激活。写下 things 是一种 “排练” 这些想法的方式, 例如练习舞蹈套路或投篮, 这使得它们更有可能坚持下去。

Enhancing our memory is just the beginning. When you express an idea in writing, it’s not just a matter of transferring the exact contents of your mind into paper or digital form. Writing creates new knowledge that wasn’t there before. Each word you write triggers mental cascades and internal associations, leading to further ideas, all of which can come tumbling out onto the page or screen.[V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-024)  
增强我们的记忆力只是一个开始。当您以书面形式表达一个想法时, 这不仅仅是将您的想法的确切内容转化为纸质或数字形式的问题。写作创造了以前不存在的新知识。你写的每一个词都会触发精神连锁反应和内部联想, 从而产生更多的想法, 所有这些想法都会涌现到页面或屏幕上。 [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-024)

Thinking doesn’t just produce writing; writing also enriches thinking.  
思考不仅仅产生写作; 写作也丰富了思维。

There is even significant evidence that expressing our thoughts in writing can lead to benefits for our health and well-being.[11](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn11) One of the most cited psychology papers of the 1990s found that “translating emotional events into words leads to profound social, psychological, and neural changes.”  
甚至有重要证据表明, 以书面形式表达我们的想法可以为我们的健康和福祉带来好处。 [11](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch04fn11) 1990 年代被引用最多的心理学论文之一发现,“将情绪事件转化为文字会导致深刻的社会、心理和神经变化。”

In a wide range of controlled studies, writing about one’s inner experiences led to a drop in visits to the doctor, improved immune systems, and reductions in distress. Students who wrote about emotional topics showed improvements in their grades, professionals who had been laid off found new jobs more quickly, and staff members were absent from work at lower rates. The most amazing thing about these findings is that they didn’t rely on input from others. No one had to read or respond to what these people wrote down—the benefits came just from the act of writing.  
在广泛的对照研究中, 写下一个人的内心体验可以减少看医生的次数, 改善免疫系统, 减少痛苦。写情感话题的学生成绩有所提高, 被解雇的专业人士更快找到新工作, 员工缺勤率更低。这些发现最令人惊奇的是它们不依赖于其他人的输入。没有人必须阅读或回应这些人写下的内容——好处来自写作这一行为。

Perhaps the most immediate benefit of capturing content outside our heads is that we escape what I call the “reactivity loop”—the hamster wheel of urgency, outrage, and sensationalism that characterizes so much of the Internet. The moment you first encounter an idea is the worst time to decide what it means. You need to set it aside and gain some objectivity.  
捕捉我们头脑之外的内容的最直接好处可能是我们摆脱了我所说的 “反应循环”—— hamster 的紧迫感、愤怒和耸人听闻的轮子, 这是互联网上如此多的特征。你第一次遇到一个想法的那一刻是决定它意味着什么的最糟糕的时间。你需要把它放在一边并获得一些客观性。

With a Second Brain as a shield against the media storm, we no longer have to react to each idea immediately, or risk losing it forever. We can set things aside and get to them later when we are calmer and more grounded. We can take our time slowly absorbing new information and integrating it into our thinking, free of the pressing demands of the moment. I’m always amazed that when I revisit the items I’ve previously saved to read later, many of them that seemed so important at the time are clearly trivial and unneeded.  
有了第二大脑作为抵御媒体风暴的盾牌, 我们不再需要立即对每个想法做出反应, 否则就有可能永远失去它。我们可以把事情搁置一旁, 等我们更冷静、更踏实时再去处理。我们可以花时间慢慢吸收新信息并将其融入我们的思维, 而不受当下紧迫需求的影响。我总是很惊讶, 当我重温我以前保存下来供以后阅读的项目时, 其中许多在当时看起来非常重要的项目显然是微不足道且不需要的。

Notetaking is the easiest and simplest way of externalizing our thinking. It requires no special skill, is private by default, and can be performed anytime and anywhere. Once our thoughts are outside our head, we can examine them, play with them, and make them better. It’s like a shortcut to realizing the full potential of the thoughts flowing through our minds.  
做笔记是将我们的思维外化的最简单、最简单的方法。它不需要特殊技能, 默认是私有的, 可以随时随地进行。一旦我们的想法脱离了头脑, 我们就可以检查它们, 玩弄它们, 并使它们变得更好。这就像一条捷径, 可以充分发挥流过我们脑海的思想的潜力。

### Your Turn: What Would This Look Like If It Was Easy?  
轮到你了: 如果这很容易, 它会是什么样子?

I’ve introduced a lot of ideas in this chapter, and I know it’s a lot to absorb. There are so many ways to capture knowledge, but when you’re just getting started all those options can just feel overwhelming.  
我在本章中介绍了很多想法, 我知道需要吸收很多东西。获取知识的方法有很多种, 但当您刚刚开始时, 所有这些选择都会让人不知所措。

I want to give you an open question that will help guide you as you embark on this journey: What would capturing ideas look like if it was easy?  
我想给你一个开放性的问题, 它将在你踏上这段旅程时帮助指导你: 如果容易的话, 捕捉想法会是什么样子?

Think about what you would want to capture more of (or less of). How would that feel? What kinds of content are already familiar enough that it would be easy to begin saving them now? What would capturing look like today or this week? On average I capture just two notes per day—what are two ideas, insights, observations, perspectives, or lessons you’ve encountered today that you could write down right now?  
考虑一下您希望捕获更多 (或更少) 的内容。那感觉如何? 什么样的内容已经足够熟悉以至于现在很容易开始保存它们? capturing 今天或本周会是什么样子? 平均而言, 我每天只记录两个笔记——你今天遇到的两个想法、见解、观察、观点或教训是什么, 你可以马上写下来?

It’s important to keep capturing relatively effortless because it is only the first step. You need to do it enough that it becomes second nature, while conserving your time and energy for the later steps when the value of the ideas you’ve found can be fully unleashed.  
保持相对轻松的捕捉很重要, 因为这只是第一步。你需要做得足够多, 让它成为第二天性, 同时为后面的步骤节省时间和精力, 当你发现的想法的价值可以完全释放时。

Capture isn’t about doing more. It’s about taking notes on the experiences you’re already having. It’s about squeezing more juice out of the fruit of life, savoring every moment to the fullest by paying closer attention to the details.  
捕获不是要做得更多。这是关于记录你已经拥有的经历。这是关于从生活的果实中榨出更多汁液, 通过更加关注细节来充分享受每一刻。

Don’t worry about whether you’re capturing “correctly.” There’s no right way to do this, and therefore, no wrong way. The only way to know whether you’re getting the good stuff is to try putting it to use in real life. We’ll get to that soon, but in the meantime, try out a couple of digital notes apps and capture tools to see which ones fit your style. Don’t forget the resource guide I’ve put together to help you make your choice.  
不必担心您是否 “正确” 捕获。没有正确的方法可以做到这一点, 因此也没有错误的方法。了解您是否得到好东西的唯一方法是尝试将其用于现实生活中。我们很快就会谈到这一点, 但与此同时, 尝试几个数字笔记应用程序和捕捉工具, 看看哪些适合你的风格。不要忘记我整理的资源指南, 以帮助您做出选择。

If at any point you feel stuck or overwhelmed, step back and remember that nothing is permanent in the digital world. Digital content is endlessly malleable, so you don’t have to commit to any decision forever. While every step of CODE complements the others, you can also use them one at a time. Start with the parts that resonate with you and expand from there as your confidence grows.  
如果在任何时候您感到受困或不知所措, 请退后一步并记住数字世界中没有什么是永恒的。数字内容具有无限的可塑性, 因此您不必永远做出任何决定。虽然 CODE 的每一步都是对其他步骤的补充, 但您也可以一次使用它们。从与您产生共鸣的部分开始, 并随着您信心的增强从那里扩展。

In the next chapter, I’ll tell you what to do with the knowledge assets you’ve gathered in your Second Brain.  
在下一章中, 我将告诉你如何处理你在第二大脑中收集的知识资产。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-028-backlink). MIT economist César Hidalgo in his book _Why Information Grows_ describes how physical products, which he calls “crystals of imagination,” allow us to turn what we know into concrete objects that other people can access: “Crystallizing our thoughts into tangible and digital objects is what allows us to share our thoughts with others.” And elsewhere: “Our ability to crystallize imagination... gives us access to the practical uses of the knowledge and knowhow residing in the nervous systems of other people.”  
    我 。麻省理工学院经济学家 César Hidalgo 在他的《为什么信息会增长》一书中描述了他称之为 “想象力的结晶” 的物理产品如何让我们将我们所知道的变成其他人可以访问的具体对象:“将我们的思想结晶成有形的和数字的对象是是什么让我们能够与他人分享我们的想法。”还有其他地方:“我们使想象力具体化的能力...... 使我们能够实际使用其他人神经系统中的知识和专有技术。”
2.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-027-backlink). If you’re looking for a more precise answer of how much content to capture in your notes, I recommend no more than 10 percent of the original source, at most. Any more than that, and it will be too difficult to wade through all the material in the future. Conveniently, 10 percent also happens to be the limit that most ebooks allow you to export as highlights.  
    二。如果你正在寻找关于在你的笔记中捕捉多少内容的更精确的答案, 我建议最多不要超过原始来源的 10%。不止于此, 以后要翻遍所有资料就太难了。方便的是, 10% 也恰好是大多数电子书允许您导出为亮点的限制。
3.  [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-026-backlink). Even if the original web page disappears, you can often use this information to locate an archived version using the Wayback Machine, a project of the Internet Archive that preserves a record of websites: [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/).  
    三、即使原始网页消失了, 您也可以经常使用此信息找到使用 Wayback Machine 的存档版本, Wayback Machine 是 Internet Archive 的一个项目, 用于保存网站记录: [https://archive.org/web/](https://archive.org/web/) 。
4.  [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-025-backlink). The software landscape is constantly changing, so I’ve created a resource guide with my continually updated recommendations of the best capture tools, both free and paid, and for a variety of devices and operating systems. You can find it at [buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources).  
    四、软件领域在不断变化, 因此我创建了一个资源指南, 其中包含我不断更新的最佳捕获工具推荐, 包括免费和付费的, 适用于各种设备和操作系统。您可以在 buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 找到它。
5.  [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-024-backlink). This is called “detachment gain,” as explained in _The Detachment Gain: The Advantage of Thinking Out Loud_ by Daniel Reisberg, and refers to the “functional advantage to putting thoughts into externalized forms” such as speaking or writing, leading to the “possibility of new discoveries that might not have been obtained in any other fashion.” If you’ve ever had to write out a word to remember how it’s spelled, you’ve experienced this.  
    诉。这被称为 “超脱增益”, 正如丹尼尔 · 赖斯伯格在《超脱增益: 大声思考的优势》中所解释的那样, 指的是“将思想转化为外化形式的功能优势”, 例如口语或写作, 从而导致“可能性以任何其他方式可能无法获得的新发现。” 如果您曾经不得不写下一个单词来记住它的拼写方式, 那么您就经历过这种情况。

Twyla Tharp is one of the most celebrated, inventive dance choreographers in modern times. Her body of work is made up of more than 160 pieces, including 129 dances, twelve television specials, six major Hollywood movies, four full-length ballets, four Broadway shows, and two figure-skating routines.  
Twyla Tharp 是现代最著名、最具创造力的舞蹈编导之一。她的作品由 160 多部作品组成, 包括 129 部舞蹈、12 部电视特别节目、六部好莱坞大片、四部芭蕾舞剧、四部百老汇演出和两部花样滑冰套路。

Dance might seem like the creative medium that could least benefit from “organizing.” It is performed live each time, using primarily the dancers’ own bodies, and often seems improvisational and spontaneous. Yet in her book _The Creative Habit_,[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn1) Tharp revealed that a simple organizing technique lies at the heart of a creative process that has propelled her through an incredibly prolific six-decade career.  
舞蹈似乎是最不能从 “组织” 中获益的创意媒介。每次都是现场表演, 主要使用舞者自己的身体, 而且往往看起来是即兴的和自发的。然而, [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn1) Tharp 在她的《创意习惯》一书中透露, 一种简单的组织技巧是创意过程的核心, 推动她度过了一个多产的六十年职业生涯。

Tharp calls her approach “the box.” Every time she begins a new project, she takes out a foldable file box and labels it with the name of the project, usually the name of the dance she is choreographing. This initial act gives her a sense of purpose as she begins: “The box makes me feel organized, that I have my act together even when I don’t know where I’m going yet. It also represents a commitment. The simple act of writing a project name on the box means I’ve started work.”  
Tharp 称她的方法为 “盒子”。每次她开始一个新项目时, 她都会拿出一个可折叠的文件盒, 并在上面贴上项目名称的标签, 通常是她正在编舞的舞蹈名称。这个 initial 行为让她在开始时有一种目标感:“这个盒子让我感觉井井有条, 即使我还不知道我要去哪里, 我也会一起行动。这也代表着一种承诺。在盒子上写下项目名称的简单动作意味着我已经开始工作了。”

Into the box she puts anything and everything related to the project, like a swirling cauldron of creative energy. Any time she finds a new piece of material—such as “notebooks, news clippings, CDs, videotapes of me working alone in my studio, videos of the dancers rehearsing, books and photographs and pieces of art that may have inspired me”—she always knows where to put it. It all goes into the box. Which means that any time she works on that project, she knows exactly where to look—in the box.  
她把与项目相关的任何东西都放进盒子里, 就像一个旋转的创意能量大锅。每当她发现一件新材料时——比如 “笔记本、新闻剪报、CD、我在工作室里独自工作的录像带、舞者排练的视频、书籍、照片和可能激发我灵感的艺术品”——她总是知道把它放在哪里。这一切都进入了盒子。这意味着无论何时她在那个项目上工作, 她都清楚地知道要看哪里——在盒子里。

In her book, Tharp tells the story of a specific project where the box proved invaluable: a collaboration with the pop rock icon Billy Joel to turn a collection of his songs into a full-length dance performance. It was a bold idea, somewhere between a concert and a musical, but quite distinct from either one. It wasn’t clear how the characters in different songs, who weren’t written as part of the same story, could be combined into the same narrative.  
在她的书中, 撒普讲述了一个特定项目的故事, 在这个项目中, 盒子被证明是无价的: 与流行摇滚偶像比利乔尔合作, 将他的歌曲集变成了完整的舞蹈表演。这是一个大胆的想法, 介于音乐会和音乐剧之间, 但与两者截然不同。目前还不清楚不同歌曲中的角色, 不是作为同一个故事的一部分, 如何组合成同一个故事。

Even a project as open-ended as this one started the same way as all the others, with her goals: “I believe in starting each project with a stated goal. Sometimes the goal is nothing more than a personal mantra such as ‘keep it simple’ or ‘something perfect’ or ‘economy’ to remind me of what I was thinking at the beginning if and when I lose my way. I write it down on a slip of paper and it’s the first thing that goes into the box.”  
即使是像这个项目这样开放式的项目, 其开始的方式也与其他所有项目相同, 她的目标是:“我相信每个项目都应以既定目标开始。有时, 目标只不过是一句个人口头禅, 例如 “保持简单” 或“完美”或“经济”, 以提醒我在迷路时一开始的想法。我把它写在一张纸条上, 它是第一个进入盒子的东西。”

For the collaboration with Joel, Tharp had two goals: The first was to understand and master the role of narrative in dance, a long-standing creative challenge that had captured her curiosity. The second goal was much more practical, but no less motivating: to pay her dancers well. She said, “So I wrote my goals for the project, ‘tell a story’ and ‘make dance pay,’ on two blue index cards and watched them float to the bottom of the Joel box... they sit there as I write this, covered by months of research, like an anchor keeping me connected to my original impulse.”  
对于与乔尔的合作, 撒普有两个目标: 第一个是理解和掌握叙事在舞蹈中的作用, 这是一个长期存在的创造性挑战, 激发了她的好奇心。第二个目标更实际, 但同样具有激励性: 给她的舞者高薪。她说,“所以我在两张蓝色索引卡上写下了我的项目目标,‘讲 一个故事’和‘让舞蹈付出代价’, 然后看着它们漂浮在乔尔盒子的底部...... 我坐在那里写这篇文章, 经过数月的研究, 就像一个锚, 让我与最初的冲动保持联系。”

After that, every bit of research and every idea potentially relevant to the project went into Tharp’s box. Recordings of Billy Joel’s music videos, live performances, lectures, photographs, news clippings, song lists, and notes about those songs. She gathered news footage and movies about the Vietnam War, important books from the era, and even material from other boxes, including research from an abandoned project that never made it onto the stage.  
在那之后, 与该项目潜在相关的每一项研究和每一个想法都进入了 Tharp 的盒子。比利 · 乔尔 (Billy Joel) 的音乐视频、现场表演、讲座、照片、新闻剪报、歌曲列表以及关于这些歌曲的注释的录音。她收集了有关越南战争的新闻片段和电影、那个时代的重要书籍, 甚至还有其他箱子里的材料, 包括来自一个从未登上舞台的废弃项目的研究。

The artifacts that Tharp collected weren’t just for her own use. They became sparks of inspiration for her team: a pair of earrings and a macramé vest shared with the costume designer; books about psychedelic light events to inspire the lighting designer; photographs from other shows and Joel’s childhood home in Long Island to discuss with the production designer.  
撒普收集的文物不仅仅供她自己使用。它们成为她团队的灵感火花: 与服装设计师共用一对耳环和一件花边背心; 有关激发照明设计师灵感的迷幻灯光事件的书籍; 其他节目的照片和乔尔在长岛的童年故居, 以与制作设计师讨论。

All this creative raw material eventually filled twelve boxes, but all the collecting and gathering from the outside world doesn’t mean that Tharp didn’t add her own creativity. For example, she found an elaborate set of notes from an early song of Joel’s called “She’s Got a Way,” which was full of innocence and sweetness. She decided to change its meaning: “In my notes you can see the song morphing into something harsher, eventually becoming two simultaneous sleazy bar scenes, one in Vietnam, the other back home. I felt obliged to run this by Billy, warning him, ‘This is going to destroy the song.’ He wasn’t worried. ‘Go for it,’ he said.”  
所有这些创意原料最终装满了十二个盒子, 但所有来自外界的收集和收集并不意味着撒普没有加入自己的创意。例如, 她从乔尔的一首名为 “她有办法” 的早期歌曲中找到了一组精心制作的音符, 这首歌充满了天真和甜蜜。她决定改变它的意思:“在我的笔记中, 你可以看到这首歌变成了更刺耳的东西, 最终变成了两个同时出现的低俗酒吧场景, 一个在越南, 另一个在家乡。我觉得有必要让 Billy 运行这个, 警告他,“这会毁了这首歌。”他并不担心。 “去吧,”他说。

Twyla Tharp’s box gave her several powerful advantages as she set out on her creative journey.  
Twyla Tharp 的盒子在她开始创作之旅时给了她几个强大的优势。

The box gave her the security to venture out and take risks: “a box is like soil to me. It’s basic, earthy, elemental. It’s home. It’s what I can always go back to when I need to regroup and keep my bearings. Knowing that the box is always there gives me the freedom to venture out, be bold, dare to fall flat on my face.”  
盒子给了她冒险和冒险的安全感:“盒子对我来说就像土壤。它是基本的, 朴实的, 元素的。这是家。当我需要重新组合并保持方向时, 这就是我 总是可以回去的地方。知道盒子总是在那里, 让我有自由去冒险、大胆、敢于摔倒。”

The box gave Tharp a way to put projects on hold and revisit them later: “The box makes me feel connected to a project... I feel this even when I’ve back-burnered a project: I may have put the box away on a shelf, but I know it’s there. The project name on the box in bold black lettering is a constant reminder that I had an idea once and may come back to it very soon.”  
这个盒子给了萨普一种搁置项目并在以后重新审视它们的方法:“这个盒子让我觉得自己与一个项目有联系...... 即使我已经搁置了一个项目, 我也会有这种感觉: 我可能已经把盒子放在了一个地方架子, 但我知道它在那里。盒子上的项目名称以黑色粗体字体不断提醒我, 我曾经有过一个想法, 可能很快就会回来。”

Finally, it gave her a way to look back on her past victories: “There’s one final benefit to the box: It gives you a chance to look back. A lot of people don’t appreciate this. When they’re done with a project, they’re relieved. They’re ready for a break and then they want to move forward to the next idea. The box gives you the opportunity to reflect on your performance. Dig down through the boxes archaeologically and you’ll see a project’s beginnings. This can be instructive. How did you do? Did you get to your goal? Did you improve on it? Did it change along the way? Could you have done it all more efficiently?”  
最后, 它给了她一种回顾过去胜利的方式:“这个盒子还有一个最后的好处: 它让你有机会回顾过去。很多人不欣赏这一点。当他们完成一个项目时, 他们会松一口气。他们准备好休息一下, 然后他们想继续下一个想法。该框让您有机会反思自己的表现。以考古学的方式深入挖掘这些盒子, 你会看到一个项目的起源。这可能很有启发性。你怎么做的? 你达到目标了吗? 你改进了吗? 一路上有变化吗? 你能更有效地完成这一切吗?

Twyla Tharp’s box reveals the true value of a simple container: it is easy to use, easy to understand, easy to create, and easy to maintain. It can be moved from place to place without losing its contents. A container requires no effort to identify, to share with others, and to put in storage when it’s no longer needed. We don’t need complex, sophisticated systems to be able to produce complex, sophisticated works.  
Twyla Tharp 的盒子揭示了一个简单容器的真正价值: 它易于使用、易于理解、易于创建且易于维护。它可以从一个地方移动到另一个地方而不会丢失其内容。容器无需努力即可识别、与他人共享以及在不再需要时存放。我们不需要复杂、精密的系统来制作复杂、精密的作品。

### The Cathedral Effect: Designing a Space for Your Ideas  
大教堂效应: 为你的想法设计一个空间

Consider how much time we spend designing and arranging our physical environment.  
想想我们花了多少时间来设计和布置我们的物理环境。

We buy nice furniture, deliberate for weeks over the color of our walls, and fiddle with the placement of plants and books. We know that the details of lighting, temperature, and the layout of a space dramatically affect how we feel and think.  
我们买了漂亮的家具, 考虑了几周的墙壁颜色, 摆弄着植物和书籍的摆放位置。我们知道, 照明、温度和空间布局的细节会极大地影响我们的感受和思考方式。

There’s a name for this phenomenon: the Cathedral Effect.[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn2) Studies have shown that the environment we find ourselves in powerfully shapes our thinking. When we are in a space with high ceilings, for example—think of the lofty architecture of classic churches invoking the grandeur of heaven—we tend to think in more abstract ways. When we’re in a room with low ceilings, such as a small workshop, we’re more likely to think concretely.  
这种现象有一个名字: 大教堂效应。 [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn2) 研究表明, 我们所处的环境极大地塑造了我们的思维。例如, 当我们在一个天花板很高的空间时——想想古典教堂的崇高建筑唤起天堂的宏伟——我们倾向于以更抽象的方式思考。当我们在一个天花板较低的房间里时, 比如一个小作坊, 我们更有可能具体地思考。

No one questions the importance of having physical spaces that make us feel calm and centered, but when it comes to your digital workspace, it’s likely you’ve spent little time, if any, arranging that space to enhance your productivity or creativity. As knowledge workers we spend many hours every day within digital environments—our computers, smartphones, and the web. Unless you take control of those virtual spaces and shape them to support the kinds of thinking you want to do, every minute spent there will feel taxing and distracting.  
没有人会质疑拥有让我们感到平静和专注的物理空间的重要性, 但是当涉及到您的数字工作空间时, 您可能很少花时间 (如果有的话) 安排该空间来提高您的工作效率或创造力。作为知识工作者, 我们每天要花很多时间在数字环境中——我们的电脑、智能手机和网络。除非你控制这些虚拟空间并塑造它们以支持你想做的各种思考, 否则在那里度过的每一分钟都会让人感到疲惫和分心。

Your Second Brain isn’t just a tool—it’s an environment. It is a garden of knowledge full of familiar, winding pathways, but also secret and secluded corners. Every pathway is a jumping-off point to new ideas and perspectives. Gardens are natural, but they don’t happen by accident. They require a caretaker to seed the plants, trim the weeds, and shape the paths winding through them. It’s time for us to put more intention into the digital environments where we now spend so many of our waking hours.  
你的第二大脑不仅仅是一个工具——它还是一个环境。这是一座知识的花园, 有熟悉的曲径通幽, 也有隐秘幽静的角落。每条途径都是新想法和新观点的起点。花园是自然的, 但它们不是偶然发生的。他们需要看守来播种植物、修剪杂草并塑造蜿蜒穿过它们的路径。现在是我们将更多注意力投入到我们现在花费大量清醒时间的数字环境中的时候了。

Once you’ve created this environment, you’ll know where to go when it’s time to execute or create. You won’t have to sit down and spend half an hour painstakingly gathering together all the materials you need to get started. Your Second Brain is like a mind cathedral that you can step into any time you want to shut out the world and imagine a world of your own.  
一旦你创建了这个环境, 你就会知道在执行或创建时去哪里。你不必坐下来花半个小时煞费苦心地收集所有材料 你需要开始。你的第二大脑就像一座心灵大教堂, 你可以随时进入, 想将世界拒之门外, 想象一个属于你自己的世界。

The next step in building your Second Brain is to take the morsels of insight you’ve begun to capture and organize them in a space where you can do your best thinking.  
构建 “第二大脑” 的下一步是将你已经开始捕捉的洞察力碎片整理到一个你可以发挥最佳思维的空间中。

### Organizing for Action: Where 99 Percent of Notetakers Get Stuck (And How to Solve It)  
组织行动: 99% 的记录者陷入困境 (以及如何解决)

As you begin to capture your ideas in a consistent way, you’re likely to experience a new sense of excitement about the information flowing all around you.  
当您开始以一致的方式捕捉您的想法时, 您可能会对周围流动的信息产生一种新的兴奋感。

You’ll start to pay closer attention to the books you read, the conversations you have, and the interviews you listen to, knowing that any interesting idea you encounter can be reliably saved and utilized. You no longer have to hope that you’ll remember your best ideas—you can ensure that you will.  
你会开始更密切地关注你读过的书、你进行的对话和你听过的采访, 知道你遇到的任何有趣的想法都可以可靠地保存和利用。你不再需要希望你会记住你最好的想法——你可以确保你会记住。

Soon, however, you’ll run head on into a new problem: what to do with all this valuable material you’ve gathered. The more diligently you collect it, the bigger this problem will be! Capturing notes without an effective way to organize and retrieve them only leads to more overwhelm.  
然而, 很快, 你就会遇到一个新问题: 如何处理你收集到的所有这些有价值的材料。收集得越用心, 这个问题就越大! 在没有有效的方式组织和检索笔记的情况下捕捉笔记只会导致更加不知所措。

I spent years trying different ways of solving the problem of how to organize my digital life. I tried techniques borrowed from organizing physical spaces, every kind of specially formatted notebook, and even the Dewey decimal system used in libraries. I tried organizing my files by date, by subject, by kind, and countless other elaborate schemes, but every method I tried soon failed.  
我花了数年时间尝试不同的方法来解决如何组织我的数字生活的问题。我尝试了从组织物理空间、各种特殊格式的笔记本、甚至图书馆中使用的杜威十进制系统中借鉴的技术。我尝试过按日期、主题、种类和无数其他精心设计的方案来组织我的文件, 但我尝试过的每一种方法很快都失败了。

The problem was that none of these systems was integrated into my daily life. They always required me to follow a series of elaborate rules that took time away from my other priorities, which meant they would quickly become outdated and obsolete. Every time I fell off the organizing wagon, I reverted to dropping all my notes and files into a folder for whichever project I was currently focused on. This ensured that at least I had exactly what I needed for my current work immediately on hand—no tagging, filing, or keywords needed.  
问题是这些系统都没有融入我的日常生活。他们总是要求我遵循一系列精心设计的 规则, 这些规则占用了我其他优先事项的时间, 这意味着它们很快就会过时和过时。每次我从组织的马车上掉下来时, 我都会恢复到将所有笔记和文件放入我当前关注的项目的文件夹中。这确保至少我手头上有我当前工作所需的东西——不需要标记、归档或关键字。

Then one day I had a realization: Why didn’t I just organize my files that way all the time? If organizing by project was the most natural way to manage information with minimal effort, why not make it the default?  
然后有一天我意识到: 为什么我不一直这样组织我的文件? 如果按项目组织是管理信息最自然的方式, 而且工作量最小, 为什么不将其设为默认方式呢?

That is what I did, and to my surprise, it worked. Over time, I refined, simplified, and tested this action-based approach with thousands of students and followers. I eventually named this organizing system PARA,[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-023) which stands for the four main categories of information in our lives: Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives. These four categories are universal, encompassing _any_ kind of information, from _any_ source, in _any_ format, for _any_ purpose.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-022)  
这就是我所做的, 令我惊讶的是, 它奏效了。随着时间的推移, 我改进、简化并与成千上万的学生和追随者一起测试了这种基于行动的方法。我最终将这个组织系统命名为 PARA, [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-023) 代表我们生活中的四大类信息: 项目、区域、资源和档案。这四个类别是通用的, 涵盖任何类型的信息, 来自任何来源, 以任何格式, 用于任何目的。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-022)

PARA can handle it all, regardless of your profession or field, for one reason: it organizes information based on _how actionable it is_, not _what kind of information it is_. The project becomes the main unit of organization for your digital files. Instead of having to sort your notes according to a complex hierarchy of topics and subtopics, you have to answer only one simple question: “In which project will this be most useful?” It assumes only that you are currently working on a certain set of projects, and that your information should be organized to support them.  
PARA 可以处理这一切, 无论您的职业或领域如何, 原因之一是: 它根据信息的可操作性而不是信息的类型来组织信息。该项目成为您数字文件的主要组织单位。不必根据复杂的主题和子主题层次结构对笔记进行分类, 您只需回答一个简单的问题:“这在哪个项目中最有用?” 它仅假定您目前正在从事一组特定的项目, 并且您的信息应该被组织起来以支持它们。

For example, say you come across a useful article on how to become more resilient and capture it in your notes. You’re sure that this information will come in handy one day, but how do you know where to put those notes in the meantime? How will you remember where to look the next time you need them? This can quickly become an anxiety-provoking decision because of the risk of making the wrong choice.  
例如, 假设您看到一篇关于如何变得更有弹性的有用文章并将其记录在笔记中。您确信这些信息总有一天会派上用场, 但是您怎么知道同时将这些笔记放在哪里呢? 下次需要它们时, 您将如何记住去哪里找? 由于做出错误选择的风险, 这很快就会成为一个令人焦虑的决定。

Most people would save this note by subject in a folder called “Psychology.” That seems like a perfectly logical choice. Here’s the problem: the subject of “Psychology” is far too broad to be useful. Imagine your future self a few weeks or months from now. In the middle of your workday, how much time will you have to search through all your notes on such a broad subject? There might be notes from many dozens of articles, books, and other resources in there, much of which won’t be actionable at all. It would take hours just to figure out what you have.  
大多数人会按主题将此笔记保存在名为 “心理学” 的文件夹中。这似乎是一个完全合乎逻辑的选择。这就是问题所在:“心理学”的主题太宽泛以至于没有用处。想象一下几周或几个月后你未来的自己。在一天的工作中, 您将有多少时间来搜索关于如此广泛主题的所有笔记? 那里可能有许多文章、书籍和其他资源的注释, 其中大部分根本无法操作。仅仅弄清楚你拥有什么就需要几个小时。

There’s another way. I will show you how to take the notes you’ve captured and save them according to a practical use case. By taking that small extra step of putting a note into a folder (or tagging it[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-021)) for a specific project, such as a psychology paper you’re writing or a presentation you’re preparing, you’ll encounter that idea right at the moment it’s most relevant. Not a moment before, and not a moment after.  
还有另一种方法。我将根据实际用例向您展示如何记下您捕获的笔记并保存它们。通过为特定项目 (例如您正在撰写的心理学论文或正在准备的演示文稿) 将笔记放入文件夹(或将其标记为 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-021) ) 这一额外的小步骤, 您会正确地遇到这个想法目前它是最相关的。片刻之前没有, 片刻之后也没有。

If there isn’t a current project that your note would be useful for, we have a couple of other options of where to put it, including dedicated places for each of the main “areas” of your life that you are responsible for, and “resources,” which is like a personal library of references, facts, and inspiration. Over time, as you complete your projects, master new skills, and progress toward your goals, you’ll discover that some notes and resources are no longer actionable. I’ll show you how to move them to your “archives” to keep them out of sight but within easy reach.  
如果当前没有您的笔记对您有用的项目, 我们还有其他几个选择可以将其放置在何处, 包括您负责的每个主要生活 “领域” 的专用位置, 以及 “资源”, 就像一个包含参考资料、事实和灵感的个人图书馆。随着时间的推移, 当您完成项目、掌握新技能并朝着目标前进时, 您会 discover 一些笔记和资源不再可操作。我将向您展示如何将它们移动到您的“档案” 中, 使它们远离视线但又触手可及。

These four categories—Projects, Areas, Resources, and Archives—make up the four categories of PARA. We’ll explore each of them soon.  
这四个类别——项目、区域、资源和档案——构成了 PARA 的四个类别。我们将很快探索它们中的每一个。

Instead of requiring tons of time meticulously organizing your digital world, PARA guides you in quickly sorting your ideas according to what really matters: your goals.  
PARA 无需花费大量时间精心组织您的数字世界, 而是指导您根据真正重要的事情: 您的目标, 快速整理您的想法。

One of the biggest temptations with organizing is to get too perfectionistic, treating the process of organizing as an end in itself. There is something inherently satisfying about order, and it’s easy to stop there instead of going on to develop and share our knowledge. We need to always be wary of accumulating so much information that we spend all our time managing it, instead of putting it to use in the outside world.  
组织的最大诱惑之一就是过于完美主义, 将组织过程本身视为目的。秩序本身就让人感到满足, 很容易止步于此, 而不是继续发展和分享我们的知识。我们需要始终保持警惕, 以免积累如此多的信息, 以至于我们将所有时间都花在了管理这些信息上, 而不是将其用于外部世界。

Instead of inventing a completely different organizational scheme for every place you store information, which creates a tremendous amount of friction navigating the inconsistencies between them, PARA can be used everywhere, across any software program, platform, or notetaking tool. You can use the same system with the same categories and the same principles across your digital life.  
与其为存储信息的每个地方发明一个完全不同的组织方案, 这会在处理它们之间的不一致时产生巨大的摩擦, PARA 可以在任何地方使用, 跨越任何软件程序、平台或笔记工具。您可以在整个数字生活中使用具有相同类别和相同原则的相同系统。

You’ll always need to use multiple platforms to move your projects forward. No single platform can do everything. The intention here is not to use a single software program, but to use a single _organizing system_, one that provides consistency even as you switch between apps many times per day. A project will be the same project whether it’s found in your notes app, your computer file system, or your cloud storage drive, allowing you to move seamlessly between them without losing your train of thought.  
您始终需要使用多个平台来推进您的项目。没有一个平台可以做所有事情。这里的目的不是使用一个单一的软件程序, 而是使用一个单一的组织系统, 即使你每天在应用程序之间切换多次, 它也能提供一致性。一个项目将是同一个项目, 无论它是在你的笔记应用程序、你的计算机文件系统还是你的云存储驱动器中, 允许你在它们之间无缝移动而不会失去你的思路。

By structuring your notes and files around the completion of your active projects, your knowledge can go to work for you, instead of collecting dust like an “idea graveyard.” The promise of PARA is that it changes “getting organized” from a herculean, never-ending endeavor into a straightforward task to get over with so you can move on to more important work.  
通过围绕你的活动项目的完成来组织你的笔记和文件, 你的知识可以为你工作, 而不是 of 像 “创意墓地” 一样收集灰尘。 PARA 的承诺是, 它将 “组织起来” 从一项艰巨的、永无止境的努力变成一项简单的任务来克服, 这样你就可以继续从事更重要的工作。

### How PARA Works: Priming Your Mind (and Notes) for Action  
PARA 的工作原理: 启动您的思想 (和笔记) 以采取行动

With the PARA system, every piece of information you want to save can be placed into one of just four categories:  
使用 PARA 系统, 您想要保存的每条信息都可以归入以下四个类别之一:

1.  **Projects:** Short-term efforts in your work or life that you’re working on now.  
    项目: 您现在正在从事的工作或生活中的短期努力。
2.  **Areas:** Long-term responsibilities you want to manage over time.  
    领域: 您希望随着时间的推移管理的长期责任。
3.  **Resources:** Topics or interests that may be useful in the future.  
    资源: 将来可能有用的主题或兴趣。
4.  **Archives:** Inactive items from the other three categories.  
    档案: 来自其他三个类别的非活动项目。

#### Projects: What I’m Working on Right Now  
项目: 我现在正在做的事情

Projects include the short-term outcomes you’re actively working toward right now.  
项目包括您现在正在积极努力的短期成果。

Projects have a couple of features that make them an ideal way to organize modern work. First, they have a beginning and an end; they take place during a specific period of time and then they finish. Second, they have a specific, clear outcome that needs to happen in order for them to be checked off as complete, such as “finalize,” “green-light,” “launch,” or “publish.”  
Projects 有几个特点, 使它们成为组织现代工作的理想方式。首先, 它们有开始和结束; 它们发生在特定的时间段内, 然后结束。其次, 他们有一个特定的、明确的结果需要发生才能被核对为完成, 例如 “完成”、“绿灯”、“启动” 或“发布”。

A project-centric way of working comes naturally in the creative and performing arts. Artists have paintings, dancers have dances, musicians have songs, and poets have poems. These are clearly identifiable, discrete chunks of work. This project-centric approach is increasingly finding its way into all knowledge work, a trend named the “Hollywood model” after the way films are made.  
以项目为中心的工作方式自然而然地出现在创意和表演艺术中。艺术家有绘画, 舞者有舞蹈, 音乐家有歌曲, 诗人有诗歌。这些是清晰可辨的、离散的工作块。这种以项目为中心的方法越来越多地渗透到所有知识工作中, 这种趋势以电影的制作方式命名为 “好莱坞模式”。

As an article in the _New York Times_[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn3) explains, “A project is identified; a team is assembled; it works together for precisely as long as is needed to complete the task; then the team disbands... The Hollywood model is now used to build bridges, design apps or start restaurants.” It is becoming more and more common for all of us to work across teams, departments, and even different companies to execute collaborative projects, and then once it’s over, each go our own way.  
正如纽约时报 [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch05fn3) 的一篇文章所解释的那样,“一个项目被确定; 组建团队; 只要需要完成任务, 它就会一起工作; 然后团队解散...... 好莱坞模式现在被用来建造桥梁、设计应用程序或开办餐馆。” 我们所有人跨团队、跨部门, 甚至不同公司来执行协作项目变得越来越普遍, 一旦项目结束, 各走各的路。

Examples of projects could include:  
项目示例可能包括:

*   **Projects at work:** Complete web-page design; Create slide deck for conference; Develop project schedule; Plan recruitment drive.  
    工作项目: 完成网页设计; 为会议创建幻灯片; 制定项目进度表; 计划招聘活动。
*   **Personal projects:** Finish Spanish language course; Plan vacation; Buy new living room furniture; Find local volunteer opportunity.  
    个人项目: 完成西班牙语课程; 计划假期; 购买新的客厅家具; 寻找当地的志愿者机会。
*   **Side projects:** Publish blog post; Launch crowdfunding campaign; Research best podcast microphone; Complete online course.  
    业余项目: 发布博客文章; 发起众筹活动; 研究最好的播客麦克风; 完成在线课程。

If you are not already framing your work in terms of specific, concrete projects, making this shift will give you a powerful jump start to your productivity. Whether you’re self-employed, at a large corporation, or somewhere in between, we are all moving toward a world of project-based work. Knowing which projects you’re currently committed to is crucial to being able to prioritize your week, plan your progress, and say no to things that aren’t important.  
如果您还没有根据特定的、具体的项目来规划您的工作, 那么进行这种转变将为您的 productivity 提供一个强大的起点。无论您是个体经营者、大公司还是介于两者之间, 我们都在朝着基于项目的工作世界迈进。了解您当前致力于哪些项目对于确定您的一周的优先级、计划您的进度以及对不重要的事情说不至关重要。

#### Areas: What I’m Committed to Over Time  
领域: 随着时间的推移, 我致力于什么

As important as projects are, not everything is a project.  
尽管项目很重要, 但并非一切都是项目。

For example, the area of our lives called “Finances” doesn’t have a definite end date. It’s something that we will have to think about and manage, in one way or another, for as long as we live. It doesn’t have a final objective. Even if you win the lottery, you’ll still have finances to manage (and it will probably require a lot more attention!).  
例如, 我们生活中称为 “财务” 的领域没有明确的结束日期。这是我们一生都必须以某种方式思考和管理的事情。它没有最终目标。即使您中了彩票, 您仍然需要管理财务(并且可能需要更多的关注!)。

In our work lives, we have various ongoing areas we’re responsible for, such as “product development,” “quality control,” or “human resources.” These are the job responsibilities that we were hired to take on. Sometimes there are others that we officially or unofficially have taken ownership of over time.  
在我们的工作生活中, 我们负责不同的持续领域, 例如 “产品开发”、“质量控制” 或“人力资源”。这些是我们受雇承担的工作职责。有时, 随着时间的推移, 我们正式或非正式地拥有其他人的所有权。

Each of these is an example of an area of responsibility, and together they make up the second main category of PARA. All these areas, both personal and professional, require certain information to be handled effectively, but they’re not the same as projects.  
其中每一个都是一个责任领域的例子, 它们一起构成了 PARA 的第二个主要类别。所有这些个人和专业领域都需要有效处理某些信息, 但它们与项目不同。

In the case of finances, you may have notes from calls with your financial advisor, receipts or invoices for business purchases, and your monthly household budget, among many other kinds of information. You might also have more speculative information to manage, like financial projections, research on personal finance software, and data on investment trends you’re keeping an eye on.  
在财务方面, 您可能有与财务顾问通话的记录、商业采购的收据或发票、每月的家庭预算, 以及许多其他类型的信息。您可能还需要管理更多投机信息, 例如财务预测、个人理财软件研究以及您关注的投资趋势数据。

For a work-related area like “product development,” you might need to save product specifications, R&D findings, notes from customer research interviews, and customer satisfaction ratings. You could also have photos of products you admire to use as design inspiration, manufacturing blueprints, or color palettes. It all depends on your relationship to that area of your life, and how you want to manage it or move it forward.  
对于 “产品开发” 等与工作相关的领域, 您可能需要保存产品规格、研发结果、客户研究访谈记录和客户满意度评级。您还可以将您欣赏的产品照片用作设计灵感、制造蓝图或调色板。这完全取决于您与生活中那个领域的关系, 以及您想如何管理它或推动它前进。

Examples of areas from your personal life could include:  
您个人生活领域的示例可能包括:

*   **Activities or places you are responsible for:** Home/apartment; Cooking; Travel; Car.  
    您负责的活动或地点: 家 / 公寓; 烹饪; 旅行; 车。
*   **People you are responsible for or accountable to:** Friends; Kids; Spouse; Pets.  
    您负责或向其负责的人: 朋友; 孩子们; 配偶; 宠物。
*   **Standards of performance you are responsible for:** Health; Personal growth; Friendships; Finances.  
    您负责的绩效标准: 健康; 个人成长; 友谊; 财政。

In your job or business: 在您的工作或业务中:

*   **Departments or functions you are responsible for:** Account management; Marketing; Operations; Product development.  
    您负责的部门或职能: 账户管理; 营销; 操作; 产品开发。
*   **People or teams you are responsible for or accountable to:** Direct reports; Manager; Board of directors; Suppliers.  
    您负责或向其负责的人员或团队: 直接下属; 经理; 董事会; 供应商。
*   **Standards of performance you are responsible for:** Professional development; Sales and marketing; Relationships and networking; Recruiting and hiring.  
    您负责的绩效标准: 专业发展; 销售和营销; 关系和网络; 招聘和雇用。

Even though areas have no final outcome, it is still important to manage them. In fact, if you look at the list above, these areas are critical to your health, happiness, security, and life satisfaction.  
即使区域没有最终结果, 管理它们仍然很重要。事实上, 如果您查看上面的列表, 这些领域对您的健康、幸福、安全和生活满意度至关重要。

While there is no goal to reach, there is a _standard_ that you want to uphold in each of these areas. For finances, that standard may be that you always pay your bills on time and provide for your family’s basic needs. For health, it may be that you exercise a certain number of times per week and keep your cholesterol below a certain number. For family, it may be that you spend quality time with them every evening and on the weekend.  
虽然没有要达到的目标, 但您希望在每个领域都坚持一个标准。对于财务, 该标准可能是您始终按时支付账单并满足家庭的基本需求。为了健康, 可能是你每周锻炼一定次数, 让你的胆固醇保持在一定数量以下。对于家人, 您可能每天晚上和周末都与他们共度美好时光。

Only you can decide what those standards are. For our purposes, it helps tremendously to have a place dedicated to each of them. That way you always have somewhere to put any thought, reflection, idea, or useful tidbit of information relevant to each important aspect of your life.  
只有您可以决定这些标准是什么。就我们的目的而言, 为他们每个人设立一个专门的地方非常有帮助。这样一来, 您总有地方可以放置与您生活的各个重要方面相关的任何想法、反思、想法或有用的信息。

#### Resources: Things I Want to Reference in the Future  
资源: 以后想参考的东西

The third category of information that we want to keep is resources. This is basically a catchall for anything that doesn’t belong to a project or an area and could include any topic you’re interested in gathering information about.  
我们要保留的第三类信息是资源。这基本上是对不属于项目或区域的任何事物的统称, 并且可以包括您有兴趣收集相关信息的任何主题。

For example: 例如:

*   **What topics are you interested in?** Architecture; Interior design; English literature; Beer brewing.  
    您对哪些主题感兴趣? 建筑学; 室内设计; 英国文学; 啤酒酿造。
*   **What subjects are you researching?** Habit formation; Notetaking; Project management; Nutrition.  
    你在研究什么课题? 习惯养成; 做笔记; 项目管理; 营养。
*   **What useful information do you want to be able to reference?** Vacation itineraries; Life goals; Stock photos; Product testimonials.  
    您希望能够参考哪些有用的信息? 假期行程; 生活目标; 库存照片; 产品评价。
*   **Which hobbies or passions do you have?** Coffee; Classic movies; Hip-hop music; Japanese anime.  
    你有哪些爱好或爱好? 咖啡; 经典电影; 嘻哈音乐; 日本动漫。

Any one of these subjects could become its own resource folder. You can also think of them as “research” or “reference materials.” They are trends you are keeping track of, ideas related to your job or industry, hobbies and side interests, and things you’re merely curious about. These folders are like the class notebooks you probably kept in school: one for biology, another for history, another for math. Any note or file that isn’t relevant or actionable for a current project or area can be placed into resources for future reference.  
这些主题中的任何一个都可以成为其自己的资源文件夹。您也可以将它们视为 “研究” 或“参考资料”。它们是您正在跟踪的趋势、与您的工作或行业相关的想法、爱好和副业兴趣, 以及您只是好奇的事情。这些文件夹就像您可能在学校保留的课堂笔记本: 一个用于生物学, 另一个用于历史, 另一个用于数学。任何与当前项目或区域不相关或不可操作的注释或文件都可以放入资源中以供将来参考。

#### Archives: Things I’ve Completed or Put on Hold  
档案: 我已经完成或搁置的事情

Finally, we have our archives. This includes any item from the previous three categories that is no longer active. For example:  
最后, 我们有我们的档案。这包括前三个类别中不再活跃的任何项目。例如:

*   Projects that are completed or canceled  
    已完成或取消的项目
*   Areas of responsibility that you are no longer committed to maintaining (such as when a relationship ends or after moving out of your apartment)  
    您不再致力于维护的责任领域 (例如关系结束或搬出公寓后)
*   Resources that are no longer relevant (hobbies you lose interest in or subjects you no longer care about)  
    不再相关的资源 (您失去兴趣的爱好或您不再关心的主题)

The archives are an important part of PARA because they allow you to place a folder in “cold storage” so that it doesn’t clutter your workspace, while safekeeping it forever just in case you need it. Unlike with your house or garage, there is no penalty for keeping digital stuff forever, as long as it doesn’t distract from your day-to-day focus. If you need access to that information in the future—for example, if you take on a project similar to one you previously completed—you can call it up within seconds.  
档案是 PARA 的重要组成部分, 因为它们允许您将文件夹放在 “冷库” 中, 这样​​它就不会弄乱您的工作空间, 同时永远妥善保管它以备不时之需。与您的房子或车库不同, 永远保留数字内容不会受到任何惩罚, 只要它不会分散您的日常注意力即可。如果您将来需要访问该信息——例如, 如果您从事与之前完成的项目类似的项目——您可以在几秒钟内调用它。

### What PARA Looks Like: A Behind-the-Scenes Snapshot  
PARA 的样子: 幕后花絮

PARA is a universal system of organization designed to work across your digital world. It doesn’t work in only one place, requiring you to use completely different organizing schemes in each of the dozens of places you keep things. It can and should be used everywhere, such as the documents folder on your computer, your cloud storage drives, and of course, your digital notes app.  
PARA 是一个通用的组织系统, 旨在在您的数字世界中运作。它不仅在一个地方有效, 还要求你在你存放东西的几十个地方中的每一个地方都使用完全不同的组织方案。它可以而且应该随处使用, 例如计算机上的文档文件夹、云存储驱动器, 当然还有数字笔记应用程序。

Let me show you what it looks like.  
让我告诉你它的样子。

Here’s an example of what the folders in my notes app look like with PARA:  
这是我的笔记应用程序中的文件夹在 PARA 中的样子的示例:

Inside each of these top-level folders, I have individual folders for the specific projects, areas, resources, and archives that make up my life. For example, here are the folders for each one of my active projects:  
在每个顶级文件夹中, 我都有用于构成我生活的特定项目、区域、资源和档案的单独文件夹。例如, 这里是我的每个活动项目的文件夹:

Inside these folders live the actual notes that contain my ideas. The number of active projects usually ranges from five to fifteen for the average person. Notice that the number of notes inside each one (indicated by the number in parentheses after the title) varies greatly, from just two to over two hundred for the book you’re reading right now.  
在这些文件夹中存放着包含我的想法的实际笔记。对于普通人来说, 活动项目的数量通常在 5 到 15 之间。请注意, 每本书中的注释数量 (由标题后括号中的数字表示) 差异很大, 对于您正在阅读的这本书, 从只有两个到超过 200 个不等。

Here are the notes found within a typical project folder for a midsize project, a remodel of our garage into a home studio (which we’ll dive deeper into in subsequent chapters):  
以下是在中型项目的典型项目文件夹中找到的注释, 将我们的车库改造成家庭工作室 (我们将在后续章节中深入探讨):

The left half of the window displays a list of the twenty-seven notes within this folder. Clicking a note, such as the one shown above containing a collection of photos we used to inspire our own remodel, reveals its contents in the right half of the window.  
窗口的左半部分显示了该文件夹中的二十七个音符的列表。单击一个注释, 例如上面显示的包含我们用来激发我们自己改造的照片集的注释, 会在窗口的右半部分显示其内容。

That’s it—just three levels of hierarchy to encompass the thousands of notes I’ve accumulated over the years: the top-level PARA categories, the project folder, and the notes themselves.  
就是这样——只有三个层次结构来包含我多年来积累的数千条笔记: 顶级 PARA 类别、项目文件夹和笔记本身。

Here is what some of my areas look like:  
这是我的一些领域的样子:

Each of these folders contains the notes relevant to each of those ongoing areas of my life. Areas related to my business begin with “FL” for Forte Labs, so they appear together in alphabetical order. Here are some of the notes in the “Health” area:  
这些文件夹中的每一个都包含与我生活中每个正在进行的领域相关的笔记。与我的业务相关的领域以 Forte Labs 的 “FL” 开头, 因此它们按字母顺序一起出现。以下是 “健康” 区域的一些注意事项:

Under resources I have folders for each of the topics I’m interested in. This information isn’t currently actionable, so I don’t want it cluttering up my projects, but it will be ready and waiting if I ever need it.  
在资源下, 我有我感兴趣的每个主题的文件夹。此信息当前不可操作, 所以我不希望 it 弄乱我的项目, 但它会准备好并在我需要时等待它。

The archives contain any folder from the previous three categories that is no longer active. I want them completely out of sight and off my mind, but in case I ever need to access research, learnings, or material from the past, it will always be preserved.  
档案包含前三个类别中不再活动的任何文件夹。我希望它们完全消失在我的视线之外, 也从我的脑海中消失, 但如果我需要访问过去的研究、学习或材料, 它们将始终被保存下来。

PARA can be used across all the different places where you store information, meaning you can use the same categories and the same rules of thumb no matter where you keep content. For example, here is the documents folder on my computer:  
PARA 可用于您存储信息的所有不同位置, 这意味着无论您在何处保存内容, 都可以使用相同的类别和相同的经验法则。例如, 这是我电脑上的文档文件夹:

And the folders for each one of my active projects:  
以及我的每个活动项目的文件夹:

Inside these folders live the files that I use to execute each project. Here is the project folder dedicated to the book you’re reading right now:  
在这些文件夹中存放着我用来执行每个项目的文件。这是专用于您正在阅读的书的项目文件夹:

### Where Do I Put This?—How to Decide Where to Save Individual Notes  
我应该把它放在哪里?——如何决定在哪里保存个人笔记

Setting up folders is relatively easy. The harder question that strikes fear into the heart of every organizer is “Where do I put this?”  
设置文件夹相对容易。让每个组织者心生恐惧的更难的问题是 “我把它放在哪里?”

Apps have made it extremely easy to capture content—it’s just a click or a tap away. However, we are given no guidance for what to do next. Where does a note go once it’s been created? What is the correct location for an incoming file? The more material piles up, the more urgent and stressful this problem becomes.  
应用程序使捕获内容变得极其容易——只需单击一下或轻点一下即可。但是, 我们没有得到下一步该做什么的指导。笔记创建后会去哪里? 传入文件的正确位置是什么? 材料堆积得越多, 这个问题就越紧迫、压力越大。

The temptation when initially capturing notes is to also try to decide where they should go and what they mean. Here’s the problem: the moment you first capture an idea is the worst time to try to decide what it relates to. First, because you’ve just encountered it and haven’t had any time to ponder its ultimate purpose, but more importantly, because forcing yourself to make decisions every time you capture something adds a lot of friction to the process. This makes the experience mentally taxing and thus less likely to happen in the first place.  
最初记录笔记时的诱惑是还试图决定它们应该去哪里以及它们的意思。问题是: 你第一次捕捉到一个想法的那一刻是试图决定它与什么相关的最糟糕的时间。首先, 因为你刚刚遇到它, 还没有时间去思考它的最终目的, 但更重要的是, 因为每次你捕捉到一些东西时都强迫自己做出决定, 这会给这个过程增加很多摩擦。这使得这种体验在精神上很费力, 因此一开始就不太可能发生。

This is why it’s so important to separate capture and organize into two distinct steps: “keeping what resonates” in the moment is a separate decision from deciding to save something for the long term. Most notes apps have an “inbox” or “daily notes” section where new notes you’ve captured are saved until you can revisit them and decide where they belong. Think of it as a waiting area where new ideas live until you are ready to digest them into your Second Brain. Separating the capturing and organizing of ideas helps you stay present, notice what resonates, and leave the decision of what to do with them to a separate time (such as a “weekly review,” which I will cover in Chapter 9).  
这就是为什么将捕捉和组织分为两个不同的步骤如此重要: 当下 “保持共鸣” 是一个独立的决定, 而不是决定长期保存一些东西。大多数笔记应用程序都有一个 “收件箱” 或“每日笔记”部分, 您捕获的新笔记会保存在其中, 直到您可以重新访问它们并决定它们属于何处。把它想象成一个等候区, 在你准备好将它们消化到你的第二大脑之前, 新的想法就在那里。将想法的捕捉和组织分开可以帮助你保持当下, 注意哪些是共鸣的, 并将如何处理它们的决定留给单独的时间(比如“每周回顾”, 我将在第 9 章中介绍)。

Once you’ve captured a batch of notes and it’s time to organize them, PARA comes into play. The four main categories are ordered by actionability to make the decision of where to put notes as easy as possible:  
一旦您捕获了一批笔记并且是时候组织它们了, PARA 就会发挥作用。四个主要类别按可操作性排序, 以便尽可能轻松地决定将注释放在哪里:

*   Projects are most actionable because you’re working on them right now and with a concrete deadline in mind.  
    项目是最可操作的, 因为你现在正在处理它们, 并且心中有一个具体的截止日期。
*   Areas have a longer time horizon and are less immediately actionable.  
    区域的时间跨度较长, 不太可立即采取行动。
*   Resources may become actionable depending on the situation.  
    根据情况, 资源可能变得可操作。
*   Archives remain inactive unless they are needed.  
    除非需要, 否则档案保持不活动状态。

This order gives us a convenient checklist for deciding where to put a note, starting at the top of the list and moving down:  
此顺序为我们提供了一个方便的清单, 用于决定在何处放置注释, 从列表顶部开始向下移动:

1.  In which project will this be most useful?  
    这在哪个项目中最有用?
2.  _If none_: In which area will this be most useful?  
    如果没有: 这在哪个领域最有用?
3.  _If none_: Which resource does this belong to?  
    如果没有: 这属于哪个资源?
4.  _If none_: Place in archives. 如果没有: 放入档案。

In other words, you are always trying to place a note or file not only where it will be useful, but where it will be useful the _soonest_. By placing a note in a project folder, you ensure you’ll see it next time you work on that project. By placing it in an area folder, you’ll come across it next time you’re thinking about that area of your work or life. By placing it in a resource folder, you’ll notice it only if and when you decide to dive into that topic and do some reading or research. By placing it in archives, you never need to see it again unless you want to.  
换句话说, 您总是试图不仅将笔记或文件放在有用的地方, 而且放在最快有用的地方。通过将注释放在项目文件夹中, 您可以确保下次处理该项目时能看到它。将它放在区域文件夹中, 下次您在考虑工作或生活的那个区域时就会遇到它。通过将它放在资源文件夹中, 只有当您决定深入研究该主题并进行一些阅读或研究时, 您才会注意到它。通过将它放入档案中, 除非您愿意, 否则您永远不需要再次看到它。

It can be easy to let our projects and goals fall by the wayside when life gets busy. Personal projects and long-term goals feel especially flexible, like you can always get around to them later. Notes, bookmarks, highlights, and research that we worked hard to find sink deeper and deeper into our file systems, until eventually we forget they even exist.  
当生活变得忙碌时, 我们的项目和目标很容易半途而废。个人项目和长期目标感觉特别灵活, 就像你以后总是可以抽空处理它们一样。我们努力寻找的笔记、书签、亮点和研究越来越深入我们的文件系统, 直到最终我们忘记它们的存在。

Organizing by actionability counteracts our tendency to constantly procrastinate and postpone our aspirations to some far-off future. PARA pulls these distant dreams into the here and now, by helping us see that we already have a lot of the information we need to get started. The goal of organizing our knowledge is to move our goals forward, not get a PhD in notetaking. Knowledge is best applied through execution, which means whatever doesn’t help you make progress on your projects is probably detracting from them.  
按可操作性进行组织可以抵消我们不断拖延并将我们的愿望推迟到某个遥远的未来的倾向。 PARA 将这些遥远的梦想带到了此时此地, 帮助我们了解我们已经拥有了开始所需的大量信息。组织我们的知识的目标是推动我们的目标向前发展, 而不是获得笔记方面的博士学位。知识最好通过执行来应用, 这意味着任何不能帮助您在项目上取得进展的事情都可能会减损它们。

### Organizing Information Like a Kitchen—What Am I Making?  
像厨房一样组织信息——我在做什么?

There is a parallel between PARA and how kitchens are organized.  
PARA 与厨房的组织方式有相似之处。

Everything in a kitchen is designed and organized to support an outcome—preparing a meal as efficiently as possible. The archives are like the freezer—items are in cold storage until they are needed, which could be far into the future. Resources are like the pantry—available for use in any meal you make, but neatly tucked away out of sight in the meantime. Areas are like the fridge—items that you plan on using relatively soon, and that you want to check on more frequently. Projects are like the pots and pans cooking on the stove—the items you are actively preparing right now. Each kind of food is organized according to how accessible it needs to be for you to make the meals you want to eat.  
厨房里的一切都经过精心设计和组织, 以支持一种结果——尽可能高效地准备一顿饭。档案馆就像冰箱一样——物品在需要时一直处于冷藏状态, 这可能是遥远的未来。资源就像食品储藏室——可供您做的任何一顿饭使用, 但同时又被整齐地藏在看不见的地方。区域就像冰箱——您计划相对较快使用的物品, 并且您希望更频繁地检查它们。项目就像在炉子上烹饪的锅碗瓢盆——你现在正在积极准备的东西。每种食物都是根据您制作自己想吃的饭菜所需的方便程度来组织的。

Imagine how absurd it would be to organize a kitchen instead by _kind of food_: fresh fruit, dried fruit, fruit juice, and frozen fruit would all be stored in the same place, just because they all happen to be made of fruit. Yet this is exactly the way most people organize their files and notes—keeping all their book notes together just because they happen to come from books, or all their saved quotes together just because they happen to be quotes.  
想象一下, 如果用食物来组织厨房是多么荒谬: 新鲜水果、干果、果汁和冷冻水果都存放在同一个地方, 只因为它们恰好都是用水果制成的。然而, 这正是大多数人组织文件和笔记的方式——将所有的书本笔记放在一起只是因为它们恰好来自书本, 或者将所有保存的引语放在一起只是因为它们恰好是引语。

Instead of organizing ideas according to _where they come from_, I recommend organizing them according to _where they are going—_specifically, the outcomes that they can help you realize. The true test of whether a piece of knowledge is valuable is not whether it is perfectly organized and neatly labeled, but whether it can have an impact on someone or something that matters to you.  
我建议不要根据想法的来源来组织想法, 而是根据它们的去向来组织它们——特别是它们可以帮助你实现的结果。真正检验一项知识是否有价值的标准, 不是它是否组织得当、标签是否整齐, 而是它能否对你所关心的人或事产生影响。

PARA isn’t a filing system; it’s a production system. It’s no use trying to find the “perfect place” where a note or file belongs. There isn’t one. The whole system is constantly shifting and changing in sync with your constantly changing life.  
PARA 不是归档系统; 这是一个生产系统。试图找到笔记或文件所属的 “完美位置” 是没有用的。没有一个。整个系统随着你不断变化的生活而不断变化。

This is a challenging idea for a lot of people to wrap their head around. We are used to organizational systems that are static and fixed. We expect to find a strict set of rules that tells us exactly where each item goes, like the precise call numbers for books in a library.  
对于很多人来说, 这是一个具有挑战性的想法。我们习惯于静态和固定的组织系统。我们期望找到一套严格的规则来告诉我们每件物品的确切去向, 例如图书馆中书籍的准确索书号。

When it comes to our personal knowledge, there is no such assigned spot. We are organizing for actionability, and “what’s actionable” is always changing. Sometimes we can receive one text message or email and the entire landscape of our day changes. Because our priorities can change at a moment’s notice, we have to minimize the time we spend filing, labeling, tagging, and maintaining our digital notes. We can’t run the risk of all that effort going to waste.  
当涉及到我们的个人知识时, 没有这样指定的位置。我们正在组织可操作性, 而 “可操作的” 是 always changing。有时我们可以收到一条短信或电子邮件, 我们一天的整个景观都会改变。因为我们的优先事项可以随时改变, 所以我们必须尽量减少花在归档、标记、标记和维护数字笔记上的时间。我们不能冒所有努力都白费的风险。

Any piece of information (whether a text document, an image, a note, or an entire folder) can and should flow between categories. You might save a note on coaching techniques to a project folder called “Coaching class,” for a class you’re taking. Later, when you become a manager at work and need to coach your direct reports, you might move that note to an area folder called “Direct reports.” At some point you might leave that company, but still remain interested in coaching, and move the note to resources. One day you might lose interest in the subject altogether and move it to the archives. In the future, that note could find its way all the way back to projects when you decide to start a side gig as a business coach, making that knowledge actionable once again.  
任何信息 (无论是文本文档、图像、笔记还是整个文件夹) 都可以而且应该在类别之间流动。您可以将有关教练技术的笔记保存到名为 “教练课程” 的项目文件夹中, 以用于您正在上的课程。稍后, 当您成为工作经理并需要指导您的直接下属时, 您可以将该注释移动到名为 “直接下属” 的区域文件夹中。在某个时候你可能会离开那家公司, 但仍然对教练感兴趣, 并将笔记移至资源。有一天你可能会完全失去对这个主题的兴趣并将它移到档案中。将来, 当您决定开始兼职作为商业教练时, 该笔记可能会一直回到项目中, 从而使该知识再次具有可操作性。

The purpose of a single note or group of notes can and does change over time as your needs and goals change. Every life moves through seasons, and your digital notes should move along with them, churning and surfacing new tidbits of insight from the deep waters of your experience.  
随着您的需求和目标的变化, 单个笔记或一组笔记的目的可以而且确实会随着时间的推移而改变。每个生命都在季节中移动, 您的数字笔记应该随之移动, 从您的经历的深水中搅动和浮现新的洞察力。

### Completed Projects Are the Oxygen of Your Second Brain  
已完成的项目是您第二大脑的氧气

Your efforts to capture content for future use will be tremendously easier and more effective if you know what that content is for. Using PARA is not just about creating a bunch of folders to put things in. It is about identifying the structure of your work and life—what you are committed to, what you want to change, and where you want to go.  
如果您知道该内容的用途, 那么您为将来使用而捕获内容的工作将变得更加容易和有效。使用 PARA 不仅仅是创建一堆文件夹来放入东西。它是关于确定你的工作和生活的结构——你致力于什么, 你想要改变什么, 以及你想去哪里。

I had to learn this lesson the hard way. Back in college, I worked part-time at an Apple Store in San Diego while I finished my studies. At the time it was one of the five busiest Apple Stores in the world, with thousands of people walking through our doors every day. It was there that I got my first taste of teaching people how to use computers more effectively.  
我不得不以艰难的方式学习这一课。回到大学时, 我一边完成学业, 一边在圣地亚哥的一家 Apple Store 做兼职。当时它是世界上最繁忙的五家 Apple Store 之一, 每天都有成千上万的人走进我们的大门。在那里, 我第一次尝到了教人们如何更有效地使用计算机的滋味。

I taught morning classes to small groups of people who had just bought their first Mac, and also did one-on-one consultation sessions. This was the golden age of Apple’s iLife suite of creative software: every single Mac computer came preinstalled with user-friendly apps for creating websites, recording music, printing photo books, and making videos. It was like having a complete multimedia studio at your fingertips at no additional cost.  
我给刚买了第一台 Mac 的一小群人上了早课, 还进行了一对一的咨询会议。这是 Apple iLife 创意软件套件的黄金时代: 每台 Mac 电脑都预装了用户友好的应用程序, 用于创建网站、录制音乐、打印相册和制作视频。这就像拥有一个触手可及的完整多媒体工作室, 无需额外费用。

I would sit down with customers and answer any questions they had about the new computer they had just bought. In most cases they had just migrated all their files over from Windows, and years of accumulated documents lay scattered across their desktop and documents folders.  
我会与客户坐下来回答他们对刚购买的新电脑的任何问题。在大多数情况下, 他们刚刚将所有文件从 Windows 迁移过来, 多年积累的文档散落在他们的桌面和文档文件夹中。

At first I tried guiding them through organizing each document one at a time. It quickly became clear that this didn’t work at all. The one-on-one sessions were only one hour, not nearly enough time to make even a dent in the hundreds or even thousands of files they had. It wasn’t time well spent anyway, because these were often old documents that weren’t relevant to their current goals or interests.  
起初, 我试着引导他们一次整理一份文件。很快就发现这根本行不通。一对一的会议只有一个小时, 时间不足以对他们拥有的数百甚至数千份文件产生影响。无论如何, 这些时间都花得不值, 因为这些通常是与他们当前的目标或兴趣无关的旧文件。

I knew I needed a new approach. I started asking questions and listening, and eventually realized that these people didn’t need or want an organized computer. They had spent all this money and time moving to a Mac because there was something they wanted to create or achieve.  
我知道我需要一种新方法。我开始提问和倾听, 最终意识到这些人不需要或不想要一台井井有条的电脑。他们花费所有这些金钱和时间转向 Mac, 因为他们想要创造或实现一些东西。

They wanted to make a video for their parents’ anniversary party, a website for their cupcake shop, or a record showcasing their band’s songs. They wanted to research their family genealogy, graduate from college, or land a better job. Everything else was just an obstacle to get past on the way to their goal.  
他们想为他们父母的周年纪念派对制作视频, 为他们的纸杯蛋糕店制作网站, 或者制作一张展示他们乐队 歌曲的唱片。他们想研究他们的家谱, 从大学毕业, 或者找到一份更好的工作。其他一切都只是他们实现目标的障碍。

I decided to take a different approach: I took all the files they’d migrated over and moved them all to a new folder titled “Archive” plus the date (for example, “Archive 5-2-21”). There was always a moment of fear and hesitation at first. They didn’t want anything to get lost, but very quickly, as they saw that they would always be able to access anything from the past, I watched them come alive with a renewed sense of hope and possibility.  
我决定采取不同的方法: 我把他们迁移过来的所有文件都移到了一个名为 “Archive” 的新文件夹中加上日期(例如,“Archive 5-2-21”)。一开始总会有片刻的恐惧和犹豫。他们不想丢失任何东西, 但很快, 当他们看到他们总是能够访问过去的任何东西时, 我看着他们带着新的希望和可能性重新焕发活力。

They had repeatedly postponed their creative ambitions to some far-off, mythical time when somehow everything would be perfectly in order. Once we set that aside and just focused on what they actually wanted to do right now, they suddenly gained a tremendous sense of clarity and motivation.  
他们一再将他们的创作抱负推迟到某个遥远的、神话般的时代, 那时一切都井然有序。一旦我们将其搁置一旁, 只关注他们现在真正想做的事情, 他们就会突然获得一种巨大的清晰感和动力。

For a while I was sure this would come back to haunt me. Eventually they’d want to go back and organize all those old files, right? I would often see the same people coming back to our store again and again. I waited expectantly in fear for someone to return and accuse me of losing all their old files.  
有一段时间我确信这会再次困扰我。最终他们会想回去整理所有那些旧文件, 对吧? 我经常会看到同一个人一次又一次地回到我们的商店。我满怀期待地等待着有人回来并指责我丢失了他们所有的旧文件。

Let me tell you: no one ever did.  
让我告诉你: 从来没有人这样做过。

Not once did someone come back and say, “You know, I’d really like to go back and organize all those files from my old computer.” What they did tell me were the stories of the impact their creative projects had: on their families, on their business, on their grades, on their career. One person organized a fundraising drive for a friend who had recently been diagnosed with leukemia. Another put together a successful application for a small business loan to start a dance studio. One student told me that the ability to tame the chaos of her digital world was the only reason she had finished college as the first graduate from her family. The details of how they organized their computer or took notes were trivial, but the impact their creativity had on their own lives and the lives of others—that was anything but.  
从来没有人回来说,“你知道, 我真的很想回去整理我旧电脑上的所有文件。” 他们告诉我的是他们的创意项目所产生影响的故事: 对他们的家庭、对他们的事业、对他们的成绩、对他们的职业。一个人为一位最近被诊断出患有白血病的朋友组织了一场筹款活动。另一个人成功申请了一笔小企业贷款, 开办了一家舞蹈工作室。一位学生告诉我, 她能够驯服数字世界的混乱, 这是她作为家里第一个毕业生完成大学学业的唯一原因。他们如何组织他们的计算机 或做笔记的细节是微不足道的, 但他们的创造力对他们自己的生活和他人的生活产生的影响——这绝不是。

There are a few lessons I took away from this experience.  
我从这次经历中吸取了一些教训。

The first is that people need clear workspaces to be able to create. We cannot do our best thinking and our best work when all the “stuff” from the past is crowding and cluttering our space. That’s why that archiving step is so crucial: you’re not losing anything, and it can all be found via search, but you need to move it all out of sight and out of mind.  
首先是人们需要清晰的工作空间才能进行创作。当过去的所有 “东西” 挤满我们的空间时, 我们就无法进行最好的思考和最好的工作。这就是归档步骤如此重要的原因: 您不会丢失任何东西, 它们都可以通过搜索找到, 但您需要将它们全部移出视线和脑海。

Second, I learned that creating new things is what really matters. I’d see a fire light up in people’s eyes when they reached the finish line and published that slideshow or exported that video or printed that résumé. The newfound confidence they had in themselves was unmistakable as they walked out of the store knowing they had everything they needed to move forward.  
其次, 我了解到创造新事物才是真正重要的。当人们到达终点线并发布该幻灯片或导出该视频或打印该简历时, 我会看到他们眼中的火光。当他们走出商店时, 他们对自己新获得的信心是显而易见的, 因为他们知道自己拥有前进所需的一切。

I’ve learned that completed creative projects are the blood flow of your Second Brain. They keep the whole system nourished, fresh, and primed for action. It doesn’t matter how organized, aesthetically pleasing, or impressive your notetaking system is. It is only the steady completion of tangible wins that can infuse you with a sense of determination, momentum, and accomplishment. It doesn’t matter how small the victories. Even the tiniest breakthrough can become a stepping-stone to more creative, more interesting futures than you can imagine.  
我了解到, 完成的创意项目是您第二大脑的血液流动。它们使整个系统保持滋养、新鲜, 并为行动做好准备。无论您的笔记系统多么有条理、多么美观或令人印象深刻, 都无关紧要。只有稳步完成实实在在的胜利, 才能让你充满决心、动力和成就感。不管胜利有多小。即使是最微小的突破也可以成为通往比你想象的更有创意、更有趣的未来的垫脚石。

### Your Turn: Move Quickly, Touch Lightly  
轮到你了: 快速移动, 轻轻触摸

A mentor of mine once gave me a piece of advice that has served me ever since: move quickly and touch lightly.  
我的一位导师曾经给我一条忠告, 从那以后一直为我服务: 动作要快, 触摸要轻。

She saw that my standard approach to my work was brute force: to stay late at the office, fill every single minute with productivity, and power through mountains of work as if my life depended on it. That wasn’t a path to success; it was a path to burnout. Not only did I exhaust my mental and physical reserves time and again; my frontal assaults weren’t even very effective. I didn’t know how to set my intentions, craft a strategy, and look for sources of leverage that would allow me to accomplish things with minimal effort.  
她看到我的标准工作方法是蛮力: 在办公室待到很晚, 让每一分钟都充满生产力, 并在堆积如山的工作中充满力量, 就好像我的生命取决于它一样。那不是通往成功的道路; 这是一条通向倦怠的道路。我不仅一次次耗尽我的精神和体力储备; 我的正面攻击甚至不是很有效。我不知道如何设定我的意图、制定策略以及寻找能让我以最小的努力完成事情的杠杆来源。

My mentor advised me to “move quickly and touch lightly” instead. To look for the path of least resistance and make progress in short steps. I want to give the same advice to you: don’t make organizing your Second Brain into yet another heavy obligation. Ask yourself: “What is the smallest, easiest step I can take that moves me in the right direction?”  
我的导师建议我 “快走轻触”。寻找阻力最小的路径, 步步为营。我想给你同样的建议: 不要让组织你的第二大脑成为另一项沉重的义务。问问自己:“让我朝着正确的方向前进的最小、最简单的步骤是什么?”

When it comes to PARA, that step is generally to create folders for each of your active projects in your notes app and begin to fill them with the content related to those projects. Once you have a home for something, you tend to find more of it. Start by asking yourself, “What projects am I currently committed to moving forward?” and then create a new project folder for each one. Here are some questions to ask yourself to help you think of the projects that might be on your plate:  
对于 PARA, 该步骤通常是为笔记应用程序中的每个活动项目创建文件夹, 并开始用与这些项目相关的内容填充它们。一旦你有了一个家, 你往往会找到更多。首先问自己,“我目前致力于推进哪些项目?” 然后为每个创建一个新的项目文件夹。这里有一些问题可以问自己, 以帮助您思考可能在您盘子里的项目:

*   **Notice what’s on your mind:** What’s worrying you that you haven’t taken the time to identify as a project? What needs to happen that you’re not making consistent progress on?  
    注意你的想法: 什么让你担心你没有花时间确定为一个项目? 您没有取得一致进展的情况需要发生什么?
*   **Look at your calendar:** What do you need to follow up on from the past? What needs planning and preparation for the future?  
    看看你的日历: 你需要跟进过去的什么? 未来需要规划和准备什么?
*   **Look at your to-do list:** What actions are you already taking that are actually part of a bigger project you’ve not yet identified? What communication or follow-up actions you’ve scheduled with people are actually part of a bigger project?  
    查看您的待办事项清单: 您已经采取的哪些行动实际上是您尚未确定的更大项目的一部分? 您与人们安排的哪些沟通或后续行动实际上是更大项目的一部分?
*   **Look at your computer desktop, downloads folder, documents folder, bookmarks, emails, or open browser tabs:** What are you keeping around because it is part of a larger project?  
    看看你的电脑桌面、下载文件夹、文档文件夹、书签、电子邮件或打开的浏览器标签: 你保留了什么, 因为它是一个更大项目的一部分?

Here’s some examples of projects my students have come up with:  
以下是我的学生提出的一些项目示例:

*   Find new doctor who accepts my insurance  
    寻找接受我的保险的新医生
*   Plan goals and agenda for annual team retreat  
    计划年度团队务虚会的目标和议程
*   Collect list of common food supplies and set up recurring deliveries  
    收集常见食品供应清单并设置定期送货
*   Develop content strategy for next quarter  
    制定下一季度的内容策略
*   Review draft of new reimbursement policy and provide feedback  
    审查新的报销政策草案并提供反馈
*   Share collaboration ideas with research partner  
    与研究伙伴分享合作想法
*   Research and draft article on health equity  
    关于健康公平的研究和文章草案
*   Complete online course on creative writing  
    完成创意写作在线课程

You could also create folders for your areas and resources, but I recommend starting only with projects to avoid creating lots of empty containers. You can always add others later when you have something to put inside them. Although you can and should use PARA across all the platforms where you store information—the three most common ones besides a notetaking app are the documents folder on your computer, cloud storage drives like Dropbox, and online collaboration suites like Google Docs—I recommend starting with just your notes app for now.  
您还可以为您的区域和资源创建文件夹, 但我建议只从项目开始, 以避免创建大量空容器。当您有东西要放入其中时, 您可以随时添加其他人。尽管您可以而且应该在存储信息的所有平台上使用 PARA——除了笔记应用程序之外最常见的三个平台是计算机上的文档文件夹、Dropbox 等云存储驱动器和 Google Docs 等在线协作套件——我建议开始现在只有你的笔记应用程序。

Practice capturing new notes, organizing them into folders, and moving them from one folder to another. Each time you finish a project, move its folder wholesale to the archives, and each time you start a new project, look through your archives to see if any past project might have assets you can reuse.  
练习捕捉新笔记, 将它们组织到文件夹中, 并将它们从一个文件夹移动到另一个文件夹。每次你完成一个项目, 将它的文件夹全部移动到档案中, 每次你开始一个新项目时, 查看你的档案, 看看是否有任何过去的项目可能有你可以重复使用的资产。

As you create these folders and move notes into them, don’t worry about reorganizing or “cleaning up” any existing notes. You can’t afford to spend a lot of time on old content that you’re not sure you’re ever going to need. Start with a clean slate by putting your existing notes in the archives for safekeeping. If you ever need them, they’ll show up in searches and remain just as you left them.  
当您创建这些文件夹并将笔记移入其中时, 不必担心重新组织或 “清理” 任何现有笔记。您无法在不确定自己是否需要的旧内容上花费大量时间。将您现有的笔记放入档案中以进行妥善保管, 从而从头开始。如果您需要它们, 它们会出现在搜索结果中并保持原样。

Your goal is to clear your virtual workspace and gather all the items related to each active project in one place. Once you do, you’ll gain the confidence and clarity to take action on those ideas, rather than letting them pile up with no end in sight.  
您的目标是清理您的虚拟工作区并将与每个活动项目相关的所有项目集中在一个地方。一旦你这样做了, 你就会有信心和清晰地对这些想法采取行动, 而不是让它们堆积如山, 看不到尽头。

The key thing to keep in mind is that these categories are anything but final. PARA is a dynamic, constantly changing system, not a static one. Your Second Brain evolves as constantly as your projects and goals change, which means you never have to worry about getting it perfect, or having it finished.  
要记住的关键是这些类别绝不是最终类别。 PARA 是一个动态的、不断变化的系统, 而不是静态的。你的第二大脑会随着你的项目和目标的变化而不断发展, 这意味着你永远不必担心让它变得完美或完成。

In the next chapter, we’ll look at how to distill the knowledge we’ve gathered to be able to put it to use effectively.  
在下一章中, 我们将研究如何提炼我们收集到的知识以便能够有效地使用它。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-023-backlink). _Para_ is a Greek word that means “side by side,” as in “parallel”; this convenient definition reminds us that our Second Brain works “side by side” with our biological brain.  
    I.Para 是一个希腊词, 意思是 “并排”, 如“平行”; 这个方便的定义提醒我们, 我们的第二大脑与我们的生物大脑“并肩” 工作。
2.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-022-backlink). As you can probably tell, I’m a big fan of four-letter frameworks. Researchers have called it the “Magic Number 4” because it is the highest number that we can count at a glance and hold in our minds without extra effort.  
    二。您可能会说, 我是四字母框架的忠实粉丝。研究人员将其称为 “神奇数字 4”, 因为它是我们无需额外努力即可一目了然并牢记在心的最高数字。
3.  [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-021-backlink). I will use the term “folder” to refer to the main unit of organization used by most notes apps; some software instead uses tags, which work just as well.  
    三、我将使用术语 “文件夹” 来指代大多数笔记应用程序使用的主要组织单位; 有些软件改为使用标签, 效果也一样。

In 1969, studio executives at Paramount Pictures were desperate to find a film director for a new movie they had purchased the rights to, a crime drama based on the New York Mafia.  
1969 年, 派拉蒙影业公司的高管迫切希望为一部他们购买了版权的新电影——一部以纽约黑手党为背景的犯罪剧——寻找电影导演。

One after another, all the top directors of the era turned the project down. They all found it too sensationalistic for their tastes. Gangster movies were known as cliché and gimmicky, and there had been several recent duds in the genre.  
一个又一个时代的顶级导演纷纷否决了这个项目。他们都觉得这对他们的口味来说太耸人听闻了。黑帮电影以陈词滥调和噱头着称, 而且最近有几部这种类型的电影失败了。

After exhausting all their top choices, studio executives approached a young film director who had done a few small indie films. The director was a relative novice, with no major commercially successful films to his name. He was an outsider, working out of San Francisco instead of Hollywood, the industry capital. And he was known as an artist who wanted to experiment with new ideas, not a director of big budget movies.  
在用尽所有最佳选择后, 制片厂高管找到了一位拍过几部小型独立电影的年轻电影导演。导演是一个相对的新手, 他的名字没有商业上成功的主要电影。他是一个局外人, 在旧金山而不是工业之都好莱坞工作。他被认为是一位想要尝试新想法的艺术家, 而不是大预算电影的导演。

That director’s name was Francis Ford Coppola, and the movie he was asked to make was, of course, _The Godfather_.  
那位导演的名字叫弗朗西斯 · 福特 · 科波拉, 他要拍的电影当然是《教父》。

Coppola initially turned down the project. As recounted in the _Hollywood Reporter_,[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn1) he said, “It was more commercial and salacious than my own taste.” However, his partner and protégé George Lucas (of future _Star Wars_ fame) noted that they were broke. Without a major infusion of cash, they’d soon be evicted.  
科波拉最初拒绝了这个项目。正如 Hollywood Reporter 所述, [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn1) 他说,“这比我自己的口味更商业化和淫秽。”然而, 他的搭档兼门生乔治 · 卢卡斯 (后来因星球大战而声名鹊起) 指出他们已经破产了。如果没有大量现金注入, 他们很快就会被驱逐。

Mounting financial pressure, plus a second reading of the novel, changed Coppola’s mind, as he realized that it could be framed as “a story that was a metaphor for American capitalism in the tale of a great king with three sons.”  
越来越大的经济压力, 再加上对小说的重读, 改变了科波拉的想法, 因为他意识到这可以被描述为 “一个在一个伟大的国王和三个儿子的故事中隐喻美国资本主义的故事”。

_The Godfather_ would go on to become one of the greatest critical and commercial successes in filmmaking history. In 2007 the American Film Institute named it the third-best American movie of all time.[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn2) It ultimately grossed $245 million, won three Oscars, and spawned a series of sequels and spinoffs eaten up by a rabid fan base obsessed with the story of the fictional Corleone family.  
教父将继续成为电影制作史上最伟大的评论和商业成功之一。 2007 年, 美国电影学院将其评为有史以来第三好的美国电影。 [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn2) 它最终获得了 2.45 亿美元的票房收入, 赢得了三项奥斯卡奖, 并催生了一系列的续集和衍生剧, 这些续集和衍生剧被痴迷于虚构的柯里昂家族故事的狂热粉丝群所吞噬。

Coppola’s strategy for making the complex, multifaceted film rested on a technique he learned studying theater at Hofstra College, known as a “prompt book.” He started by reading _The Godfather_ novel and capturing the parts that resonated with him in a notebook—his own version of Twyla Tharp’s box. But his prompt book went beyond storage: it was the starting point for a process of revisiting and refining his sources to turn them into something new.  
科波拉制作这部复杂、多方面的电影的策略基于他在霍夫斯特拉学院学习戏剧时学到的一种技术, 被称为 “提示书”。他从阅读《教父》小说开始, 并将与他产生共鸣的部分记在笔记本上——他自己版本的 Twyla Tharp 盒子。但他的提示书不仅仅是存储: 它是重新访问和提炼他的资源以将它们变成新事物的过程的起点。

The book was made from a three-ring binder, into which he would cut and paste pages from the novel on which the film was based. It was designed to last, with reinforced grommets to ensure the pages wouldn’t tear even after many turnings. There he could add the notes and directions that would later be used to plan the screenplay and production design of the film.  
这本书是用一个三环活页夹做成的, 他会把电影所依据的小说中的几页剪切并粘贴到里面。它的设计经久耐用, 带有加固的索环以确保页面即使在多次转动后也不会撕裂。他可以在其中添加注释和说明, 这些注释和说明稍后将用于规划电影的剧本和制作设计。

In a short documentary titled _Francis Coppola’s Notebook_[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn3) released in 2001, Coppola explained his process. He started with an initial read of the entire novel, noting down anything that stuck out to him: “I think it’s important to put your impressions down on the first reading because those are the initial instincts about what you thought was good or what you didn’t understand or what you thought was bad.”  
在 2001 年发行的名为 Francis Coppola 的笔记本 [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn3) 的短片中, Coppola 解释了他的过程。他从初读整本小说开始, 记下任何让他印象深刻的地方:“我认为在第一次阅读时留下你的印象很重要, 因为这些是你最初的直觉, 你认为什么是好的, 什么不是你认为好的不明白或者你认为不好的地方。

Coppola then began to add his own interpretations, distilling and reconstituting his own version of the story. He broke down each scene according to five key criteria: a synopsis (or summary) of the scene; the historical context; the imagery and tone for the “look and feel” of a scene; the core intention; and any potential pitfalls to avoid. In his own words, “I endeavored to distill the essence of each scene into a sentence, expressing in a few words what the point of the scene was.”  
科波拉随后开始添加自己的解释, 提炼和重构他自己的故事版本。他根据五个关键标准分解每个场景: 场景的概要 (或摘要); 历史背景; 场景“外观和感觉” 的意象和色调; 核心意图; 以及要避免的任何潜在陷阱。用他自己的话说,“我努力把每个场景的精髓提炼成一句话, 用几句话表达场景的重点。”

Coppola described his binder as “a kind of multi-layered road map for me to direct the film... so I was able to review not only Mario Puzo’s original text but all my first notation as to what... was important to me or what I felt was really going on in the book.” His comments in the margins included “Hitchcock” to remind him of how the famed director of thrillers would have framed a shot, or “Frozen time” to remind him to slow down a sequence. He used different kinds of annotations to emphasize to his future self which parts of a scene were most important: “As I was reading the book and making these notes and then putting them on the margins obviously the more pens I was using and the more rulers, and the more squiggly lines, sort of implied the excitement of the book was higher and higher, so that the sheer amount of ink on the page would tell me later on this is one of the most important scenes.”  
科波拉将他的活页夹描述为 “我导演这部电影的一种多层次路线图...... 所以我不仅可以回顾马里奥 · 普佐的原文, 还可以回顾我所有关于什么...... 对我很重要或我的感受的第一个符号书中真的发生了。” 他在页边空白处的评论包括“希区柯克”, 以提醒他这位著名的惊悚片导演是如何构图的, 或者“冰冻时间”, 以提醒他放慢一个序列。他使用不同类型的注释向未来的自己强调场景的哪些部分最重要:“当我阅读这本书并做这些笔记然后将它们放在页边空白处时, 显然我使用的笔越多, 尺子越多, 还有更多的波浪线, 某种程度上暗示着这本书的精彩程度越来越高, 以至于页面上的大量墨水稍后会告诉我这是最重要的场景之一。”

The Godfather Notebook is a perfect example of the behind-the-scenes process used by successful creative professionals. Coppola considered the prompt book that emerged from this process the most important asset in the production of his now classic film: “the script was really an unnecessary document; I didn’t need a script because I could have made the movie just from this notebook.”  
教父笔记本是成功的创意专业人士使用的幕后流程的完美示例。科波拉认为从这个过程中产生的提示书是他现在的经典电影制作中最重要的资产:“脚本 确实是一个不必要的文件; 我不需要剧本, 因为我可以用这本笔记本拍电影。”

We might imagine a movie as emerging straight out of the mind of a screenplay writer or director, when in fact it depends on collecting and refining source material. Coppola’s story demonstrates that we can systematically gather building blocks from our reading and research that ultimately make the final product richer, more interesting, and more impactful.  
我们可能会想象一部电影是直接从编剧或导演的脑海中浮现出来的, 而实际上它取决于收集和提炼原始资料。科波拉的故事表明, 我们可以系统地从阅读和研究中收集构建模块, 最终使最终产品更丰富、更有趣、更有影响力。

If Francis Ford Coppola relied so much on a step-by-step process for notetaking, then so can we. We can also use our notes to drill down to the essence of the stories, research, examples, and metaphors that make up our own source material. This is the third step of CODE, to Distill. This is the moment we begin turning the ideas we’ve captured and organized into our own message. It all begins and ends with notes.  
如果弗朗西斯 · 福特 · 科波拉如此依赖循序渐进的记笔记过程, 那么我们也可以。我们还可以使用我们的笔记深入了解构成我们自己的原始资料的故事、研究、示例和隐喻的本质。这是 CODE 的第三步, 蒸馏。这是我们开始将我们捕获和组织的想法转化为我们自己的信息的时刻。这一切都以笔记开始和结束。

### Quantum Notetaking: How to Create Notes for an Unknown Future  
量子笔记: 如何为未知的未来做笔记

I’ve shown you how to capture notes with interesting ideas from the outside world or your own thoughts. You may have started organizing those notes according to their actionability and relevance to your current projects.  
我已经向您展示了如何用来自外部世界或您自己的想法的有趣想法来记录笔记。您可能已经开始根据它们的可操作性和与您当前项目的相关性来组织这些笔记。

Now what? 怎么办?

This is where even the most dedicated notetakers usually stop. They aren’t sure what to do next. They’ve gathered some interesting knowledge, but it hasn’t led anywhere. Our notes are things to use, not just things to collect.  
这是即使是最专注的笔记者通常也会停下来的地方。他们不确定下一步该做什么。他们收集了一些有趣的知识, 但并没有取得任何进展。我们的笔记是要使用的东西, 而不仅仅是要收集的东西。

When you initially capture a note, you may have only seconds to get it into your Second Brain before the next meeting, urgent task, or crying child comes calling. Not nearly enough time to fully understand what it means or how it might be used. When you first capture them, your notes are like unfinished pieces of raw material. They require a bit more refinement to turn them into truly valuable knowledge assets, like a chemist distilling only the purest compound. This is why we separate capturing and organizing from the subsequent steps: you need to be able to store something quickly and save any future refinement for later.  
当您最初记下一个笔记时, 您可能只有几秒钟的时间将其输入您的第二大脑, 然后才能召开下一次会议、紧急任务或哭闹的孩子。没有足够的时间来完全理解它的含义或如何使用它。当您第一次捕捉它们时, 您的笔记就像是未完成的原材料。他们需要更多的改进才能将它们变成真正有价值的知识资产, 就像化学家只提炼出最纯净的化合物一样。这就是我们将捕获和组织与后续步骤分开的原因: 您需要能够快速存储某些内容并保存任何未来的改进以备后用。

In this sense, notetaking is like time travel—you are sending packets of knowledge through time to your future self.  
从这个意义上说, 记笔记就像时间旅行——你正在通过时间将知识包发送给未来的自己。

You probably consume a lot of books, articles, videos, and social media posts full of interesting insights, but what are the chances that you’ll be ready to put any given piece of advice into action right at that instant? How likely is it that life will intervene, in the form of a crisis at work, an urgent meeting at your kid’s school, or an unexpected cold? In my experience, life is constantly pushing and pulling us away from our priorities. The more determined we are to focus and get something done, the more aggressively life tends to throw emergencies and delays in our face.  
您可能阅读了大量充满有趣见解的书籍、文章、视频和社交媒体帖子, 但您准备好立即将任何给定建议付诸行动的可能性有多大? 生活以工作危机、孩子学校的紧急会议或意外感冒的形式介入的可能性有多大? 根据我的经验, 生活不断地推动和拉动我们远离我们的优先事项。我们越坚定地专注并完成某件事, 生活就越倾向于将紧急情况和延误抛在我们面前。

You’re watching a YouTube video on home renovation now, but that knowledge can be put to use only in a few months, when you move into your new place. You’re reading an article about time management techniques now, but they end up being most useful at the end of the year, when your new child is born and you suddenly have much greater demands on your time. You’re talking to a sales prospect about their goals and challenges now, but when you could really use that information is next year, when they start taking bids for a huge new contract.  
您现在正在观看有关家庭装修的 YouTube 视频, 但这些知识只能在您搬入新住所后的几个月内派上用场。你现在正在阅读一篇关于时间管理技巧的文章, 但它们最终在年底最有用, 那时你的新孩子出生了, 你突然对你的时间有了更多的要求。您现在正在与销售潜在客户谈论他们的目标和挑战, 但您真正可以使用这些信息的时间是明年, 那时他们将开始为一份巨大的新合同进行投标。

This holds true for so much of the ideas and inspiration around us. There is a key idea that catches our attention in the moment. We feel enraptured and obsessed with it. It’s difficult to imagine ever forgetting the new idea. It’s changed our lives forever! But after a few hours or days or weeks, it starts to fade from our memory. Soon our recollection of that exciting new idea is nothing but a pale shadow of something we once knew, that once intrigued us. Your job as a notetaker is to preserve the notes you’re taking on the things you discover in such a way that they can survive the journey into the future. That way your excitement and enthusiasm for your knowledge builds over time instead of fading away.  
这适用于我们周围的许多想法和灵感。有一个关键的想法立即引起了我们的注意。我们对此感到欣喜若狂和着迷。很难想象会忘记这个新想法。它永远改变了我们的生活! 但几个小时、几天或几周后, 它开始从我们的记忆中消失。很快, 我们对那个令人兴奋的新想法的回忆只不过是 something 我们曾经知道的、曾经让我们感兴趣的东西的苍白影子。作为记笔记者, 你的工作是保存你正在做的关于你发现的事情的笔记, 这样它们就可以在未来的旅程中幸存下来。这样, 你对知识的兴奋和热情会随着时间的推移而增强, 而不是消退。

### Discoverability—The Missing Link in Making Notes Useful  
可发现性——使笔记有用的缺失环节

The most important factor in whether your notes can survive that journey into the future is their _discoverability_—how easy it is to discover what they contain and access the specific points that are most immediately useful.  
决定你的笔记能否在未来的旅程中幸存下来的最重要因素是它们的可发现性——发现它们包含的内容并访问最直接有用的特定点是多么容易。

Discoverability is an idea from information science that refers to “the degree to which a piece of content or information can be found in a search of a file, database, or other information system.”[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-020) Librarians think about discoverability when deciding how to lay out books on the shelves. Web designers think about it when they create menus for the websites you visit every day. Social media platforms work hard to make the best content on their platforms as discoverable as possible.  
可发现性是信息科学的一个概念, 指的是 “在文件、数据库或其他信息系统的搜索中可以找到一段内容或信息的程度”。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-020) 图书馆员在决定如何在书架上布置书籍时会考虑可发现性。网页设计师在为您每天访问的网站创建菜单时会考虑到这一点。社交媒体平台努力使平台上最好的内容尽可能地被发现。

Discoverability is the element most often missing from people’s notes. It’s easy to save tons and tons of content, but turning it into a form that will be accessible in the future is another matter. To enhance the discoverability of your notes, we can turn to a simple habit you probably remember from school: highlighting the most important points. Highlighting is an activity that everyone understands, takes hardly any additional effort, and works in any app you might use.  
可发现性是人们笔记中最常缺少的元素。保存成吨的内容很容易, 但是将其变成将来可以访问的形式是另一回事。为了提高笔记的可发现性, 我们可以养成您可能在学校记得的一个简单习惯: 突出显示最重要的点。突出显示是一项每个人都能理解的活动, 几乎不需要任何额外的努力, 并且适用于您可能使用的任何应用程序。

Imagine your future self as a demanding customer. They will surely be impatient and very busy. They won’t have time to pore through page after page of details just to find the hidden gems. It’s your job to “sell” them on the value of the notes you are taking now. Your future self might have mere minutes before a meeting starts to quickly search their notes for a reference they need. In that sense, each note is like a product you are creating for the benefit of that future customer. If they don’t buy it—they don’t think it’s worth the effort of revisiting past notes—then all the value of the work you’re doing now will be lost.  
把你未来的自己想象成一个苛刻的客户。他们肯定会很不耐烦而且很忙。他们将没有时间仔细阅读 page 一页又一页的细节, 只是为了找到隐藏的宝石。你的工作是根据你现在所记笔记的价值 “出售” 它们。你未来的自己可能在会议开始前只有几分钟的时间快速搜索他们的笔记以寻找他们需要的参考。从这个意义上说, 每张纸条都像是您为未来客户的利益而创造的产品。如果他们不买账——他们认为重温过去的笔记不值得——那么你现在所做工作的所有价值都将丢失。

This points to a paradox that a lot of people experience as they take notes: the more notes they gather, the more the volume of information grows, the more time and effort it takes to review it all, and the less time they have to do so. Paradoxically, the more notes they collect, the less discoverable they become! This realization tends to either discourage them from taking any notes in the first place, or alternatively, to keep switching from one notetaking tool to another every time the volume gets overwhelming. Thus, they miss out on most of the benefits of their knowledge compounding over time.  
这指向了很多人在做笔记时都会经历的一个悖论: 他们收集的笔记越多, 信息量就越大, 复习所有内容所需的时间和精力就越多, 而他们要做的时间就越少所以。矛盾的是, 他们收集的笔记越多, 他们就越不容易被发现! 这种认识往往会阻止他们一开始就做任何笔记, 或者每次当音量变得不堪重负时, 他们就会不断地从一种笔记工具切换到另一种笔记工具。因此, 随着时间的推移, 他们错过了知识复合的大部分好处。

What do you do when communicating with a very busy, very impatient, very important person? You distill your message down to the key points and action steps. When you send an email to your boss, you don’t bury your request somewhere near the bottom of a massive wall of text. You identify the most urgent questions that you need them to respond to right at the top of the email. When you’re giving a presentation to the leadership of your organization, you don’t drone on for hours. You leave out unnecessary details and get right to the point.  
当你与一个非常忙碌、非常不耐烦、非常重要的人交流时, 你会怎么做? 您将信息提炼为关键点和行动步骤。当您向老板发送电子邮件时, 您不会将您的请求埋在大量文本墙底部附近的某个地方。您可以在电子邮件的顶部确定您需要他们回复的最紧迫的问题。当您向组织的领导层做演示时, 您不会一连几个小时都在喋喋不休。你省去了不必要的细节, 开门见山。

Distillation is at the very heart of all effective communication. The more important it is that your audience hear and take action on your message, the more distilled that message needs to be. The details and subtleties can come later once you have your audience’s attention.  
提炼是所有有效沟通的核心。您的听众听到您的信息并对其采取行动越重要, 该信息就越需要提炼。一旦你引起了观众的注意, 细节和微妙之处就会出现。

What if your future self was just as important as these VIPs? How could you communicate with them through time in the most efficient, concise way?  
如果你未来的自己和这些贵宾一样重要怎么办? 您如何以最有效、最简洁的方式与他们进行时空沟通?

### Highlighting 2.0: The Progressive Summarization Technique  
Highlighting 2.0: 渐进式摘要技术

Progressive Summarization is the technique I teach to distill notes down to their most important points. It is a simple process of taking the raw notes you’ve captured and organized and distilling them into usable material that can directly inform a current project.  
渐进式总结是我教授的一种技巧, 可以将笔记提炼成最重要的要点。这是一个简单的过程, 将您捕获和组织的原始笔记提炼成可以直接为当前项目提供信息的可用材料。

Progressive Summarization takes advantage of a tool and a habit that we are all intimately familiar with—highlighting—while leveraging the unique capabilities of technology to make those highlights far more useful than anything you did in school.  
Progressive Summarization 利用我们都非常熟悉的工具和习惯——突出显示——同时利用技术的独特功能使这些突出显示比你在学校所做的任何事情都更有用。

The technique is simple: you highlight the main points of a note, and then highlight the main points of _those_ highlights, and so on, distilling the essence of a note in several “layers.” Each of these layers uses a different kind of formatting so you can easily tell them apart.  
技巧很简单: 突出笔记的要点, 然后突出这些亮点的要点, 依此类推, 将笔记的本质提炼成几个 “层”。这些层中的每一层都使用不同类型的格式, 因此您可以轻松区分它们。

Here is a snapshot of the four layers of Progressive Summarization:[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-019)  
这是四层渐进式总结的快照: [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-019)

Here’s an example of a note I captured from an article in _Psychology Today_.[4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn4) I came across the link when it was shared on social media and saved it with two clicks to my read later app, where I collect bookmarks of everything I want to read, watch, or listen to. A few evenings later, when I wanted to do some casual reading to wind down for the day, I read the article and highlighted the passages I found most interesting. I have my read later app synced to my digital notes app, so any passage I highlight there automatically gets saved in my notes, including a link to the source.  
这是我从《今日心理学》的一篇文章中截取的笔记示例。 [4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn4) 当链接在社交媒体上共享时, 我偶然发现了该链接, 并通过单击两次将其保存到我的稍后阅读应用程序中, 我在其中收集了我想阅读、观看或收听的所有内容的书签。几个晚上后, 当我想做一些休闲阅读以放松一天时, 我阅读了这篇文章并突出显示了我觉得最有趣的段落。我将我的稍后阅读应用程序同步到我的数字笔记应用程序, 因此我在此处突出显示的任何段落都会自动保存在我的笔记中, 包括指向源的链接。

This is what I call “layer one”—the chunks of text initially captured in my notes. Notice that I didn’t save the entire article—only a few key excerpts.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-018) By limiting what I keep to only the best, most important, most relevant parts, I’m making all the subsequent steps of organizing, distilling, and expressing much easier. If I ever need to know the full details, I have the link to the original article right there at the bottom.  
这就是我所说的 “第一层”——最初在我的笔记中捕获的文本块。请注意, 我没有保存整篇文章——只保存了 几个关键摘录。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-018) 通过将我保留的内容限制为最好、最重要、最相关的部分, 我使所有后续的组织、提炼和表达步骤变得更加容易。如果我需要了解全部细节, 我可以在底部找到原始文章的链接。

As interesting as this content is, it’s not nearly succinct enough. Once again, in the midst of a chaotic workday, I would be hard-pressed to find the time to casually look through multiple paragraphs of text to find the relevant points. Unless I highlight those points in a way that my future self can instantly grasp, I’ll likely never see them again.  
尽管此内容很有趣, 但还不够简洁。又一次, 在忙碌的工作日里, 我很难抽出时间随意翻阅多段文字, 找到相关的要点。除非我以未来的自己可以立即掌握的方式强调这些要点, 否则我可能再也见不到它们了。

To enhance the discoverability of this note, I need to add a second layer of distillation. I usually do this when I have free time during breaks or on evenings or weekends, when I come across the note while working on other projects, or when I don’t have the energy for more focused work. All I have to do is bold the main points within the note. This could include keywords that provide hints of what this text is about, phrases that capture what the original author was trying to say, or sentences that especially resonated with me even if I can’t explain why. Looking over the bolded parts of the same note below, can you see how much easier it is to quickly grasp the gist of this note by looking only at those parts?  
为了提高这篇笔记的可发现性, 我需要添加第二层蒸馏。我通常会在休息时间、晚上或周末有空闲时间时、在处理其他项目时偶然发现笔记时, 或者当我没有精力专注于更专注的工作时这样做。我所要做的就是将笔记中的要点加粗。这可能包括提供本文内容提示的关键字、捕捉原作者试图表达的内容的短语, 或者即使我无法解释原因也能引起我特别共鸣的句子。查看下面同一注释的粗体部分, 您能看出仅通过查看这些部分更容易快速掌握该注释的要点吗?

At layer two, this note is already dramatically more discoverable. Imagine the difference between reading the original article, which might take five to ten minutes of focused attention, versus glancing over these bolded points, which would take less than a minute.  
在第二层, 这个笔记已经非常容易被发现。想象一下阅读原文和浏览这些粗体点之间的区别, 前者可能需要集中注意力五到十分钟, 后者只需不到一分钟。

We’re not done yet! For those notes that are especially long, interesting, or valuable, it is sometimes worth adding a third layer of highlighting. I advise using the “highlighting” feature offered by most notes apps, which paints passages in bright yellow just like the fluorescent highlighters we used in school (which appear in light gray below). If your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature, you can use underlining or another kind of formatting instead. Look only at the bolded passages you identified in layer two and highlight only the most interesting and surprising of those points. This will often amount to just one or two sentences that encapsulate the message of the original source.  
我们还没有完成! 对于那些特别长、有趣或有价值的笔记, 有时值得添加第三层突出显示。我建议使用大多数笔记应用程序提供的 “突出显示” 功能, 该功能将段落涂成亮黄色, 就像我们在学校使用的荧光笔 (在下面显示为浅灰色) 一样。如果您的笔记应用程序没有突出显示功能, 您可以使用下划线或其他格式来代替。仅查看您在第二层中识别的粗体段落, 并仅突出显示这些要点中最有趣和最令人惊讶的部分。这通常只是一两句话来概括原始来源的信息。

Looking at the note above, can you see how those few highlighted sentences jump out and catch your eye? They convey the main message of this article in a highly distilled form that takes just seconds to grasp. When I come across this note in the future—while doing a search or browsing the notes within a folder—I’ll be able to decide in the blink of an eye whether this source is relevant to my needs. If it is, I’ll have all the additional details and context I need to remember it right in front of me, as well as the link to the original article to check the source.  
看看上面的注释, 你能看出那几个突出显示的句子是如何跳出来并抓住你的眼球的吗? 它们以高度提炼的形式传达了本文的主要信息, 只需几秒钟即可掌握。将来当我在搜索或浏览文件夹中的笔记时遇到这个笔记时, 我将能够在眨眼间决定这个来源是否与我的需要相关。如果是, 我将在我面前提供我需要记住的所有其他详细信息和上下文, 以及原始文章的链接以检查来源。

There is one more layer we can add, though it is quite rarely needed. For only the very few sources that are truly unique and valuable, I’ll add an “executive summary” at the top of the note with a few bullet points summarizing the article in my own words. The best sign that a fourth layer is needed is when I find myself visiting a note again and again, clearly indicating that it is one of the cornerstones of my thinking. Looking only at the points I’ve previously bolded and highlighted in layers two and three makes it far easier to write this summary than if I was trying to summarize the entire article all at once.  
我们可以再添加一层, 尽管很少需要它。对于真正独特且有价值的极少数资源, 我将在注释顶部添加一个 “执行摘要”, 其中包含一些要点, 用我自己的话对文章进行总结。需要第四层的最好迹象是当我发现自己一次又一次地访问一个笔记时, 清楚地表明它是我思考的基石之一。 只看我之前在第二层和第三层中加粗和突出显示的点, 这比我试图一次总结整篇文章更容易写这个总结。

I recommend using bullet points to encourage yourself to make this executive summary succinct. Use your own words, define any unusual terms you’re using, and think about how your future self, who may not remember anything about this source, might interpret what you’re writing.  
我建议使用要点来鼓励自己使这份执行摘要简洁明了。用你自己的话, 定义你正在使用的任何不寻常的术语, 并思考你未来的自己, 可能不记得这个来源的任何事情, 可能会如何解释你正在写的东西。

By reviewing this executive summary, I can rapidly recall the main takeaways from this article in a fraction of the time it would take to reread the original. Since the takeaways are already in my own words, they are easy to incorporate into whatever I’m working on. Speed is everything when it comes to recall: you have only a limited amount of time and energy, and the faster you can move through your notes, the more diverse and interesting ideas you can connect together.  
通过回顾这份执行摘要, 我可以快速回忆起这篇文章的主要内容, 而所花的时间只是重新阅读原文所花时间的一小部分。由于要点已经用我自己的话表达出来, 因此很容易将它们融入到我正在做的任何事情中。谈到回忆, 速度就是一切: 你只有有限的时间和精力, 你翻阅笔记的速度越快, 你就能将越多、越有趣的想法联系在一起。

### Zooming In and Out of Your Map of Knowledge  
放大和缩小你的知识地图

The layers of Progressive Summarization give you multiple ways of interacting with your notes depending on the needs of the moment. The first time you read about a new idea, you might want to dive into the details and explore every nuance. The next time you revisit that idea, you probably don’t want to repeat all that effort and read the same piece from beginning to end again. You want to pick up where you left off, looking only at the highlights left over from the last time you visited that note. You can review all the details at layer one, or if you’re pressed for time (and when are we ever not pressed for time?), just focus on layers two, three, or four. You can _customize_ how much attention you spend on a note based on your energy level and time available.  
渐进式总结的层次为您提供了多种方式来根据当时的需要与您的笔记进行交互。第一次阅读新想法时, 您可能想要深入了解细节并探索每一个细微差别。下次你重新审视这个想法时, 你可能不想重复所有的努力并再次从头到尾阅读同一篇文章。您想从上次中断的地方继续, 只查看上次访问该笔记时留下的亮点。您可以查看第一层的所有细节, 或者如果您时间紧迫 (我们什么时候没有时间紧迫?), 只需关注第二层、第三层或第四层。您可以根据您的能量水平和可用时间自定义您在笔记上花费的注意力。

It’s like having a digital map of your notes that can be zoomed in or out depending on how many details you want to see, like a maps app on your smartphone. Navigating to a new destination, you might want to zoom in and see exactly which driveway to turn into. On the other hand, if you’re planning a cross-country road trip, you might want to zoom out and see your entire itinerary in one glance. The same is true for your landscape of knowledge—sometimes you want to zoom in and examine one specific research finding, while other times you want to zoom out and see the broad sweep of an argument all at once.  
这就像你的笔记的数字地图, 可以根据你想看到多少细节来放大或缩小, 就像你智能手机上的地图应用程序一样。导航到新目的地时, 您可能想要放大并准确查看要转入的车道。另一方面, 如果您计划进行一次越野公路旅行, 您可能希望缩小并一眼看清您的整个行程。对于你的知识图景也是如此——有时你想放大并检查一个特定的研究发现, 而 其他时候你想缩小并同时看到一个论点的广泛范围。

With Progressive Summarization, you are building up a map of the best ideas found in your Second Brain. Your highlights are like signposts and waypoints that help you navigate through the network of ideas you’re exploring. You are building this map without moving anything or deleting anything. Every sentence gets left right where you found it, giving you the freedom to leave things out without worrying that you’ll lose them. With this map in hand, you can actually see what you’ve captured, helping you find what you’re looking for but also what you don’t even know you’re looking for.  
借助渐进式总结, 您正在构建第二大脑中发现的最佳想法的地图。你的亮点就像路标和路标, 可以帮助你在你正在探索的想法网络中导航。您正在构建此地图而无需移动或删除任何内容。每句话都在您找到它的地方, 让您可以自由地省略一些东西, 而不必担心会丢失它们。有了这张地图, 您实际上可以看到您捕获的内容, 帮助您找到您正在寻找的内容以及您甚至不知道自己在寻找的内容。

Highlighting can sometimes feel risky. You may wonder, “Am I making the right decision about which points are most important, or what this source means?” The multiple layers of Progressive Summarization are like a safety net; if you go in the wrong direction, or make a mistake, you can always just go back to the original version and try again. Nothing gets forgotten or deleted.  
突出显示有时会让人觉得有风险。您可能会想,“关于哪些点最重要, 或者这个来源意味着什么, 我做出的决定是否正确?” Progressive Summarization 的多层就像一个安全网; 如果你走错了方向, 或者犯了错误, 你总是可以回到原来的版本再试一次。什么都不会被遗忘或删除。

Progressive Summarization helps you focus on the _content_ and the _presentation_ of your notes,[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-017) instead of spending too much time on labeling, tagging, linking, or other advanced features offered by many information management tools. It gives you a practical, easy thing to do that adds value even when you don’t have the energy for more challenging tasks. Most importantly, it keeps your attention on the substance of what you’re reading or learning, which is what matters in the long term.  
渐进式摘要帮助您专注于笔记的内容和呈现方式, [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-017) 而不是花费太多时间在标签、标记、链接或许多信息管理工具提供的其他高级功能上。它为您提供了一件实用、简单的事情, 即使您没有精力完成更具挑战性的任务, 也能增加价值。最重要的是, 它让你的注意力集中在你正在阅读或学习的内容上, 从长远来看, 这才是最重要的。

Progressive Summarization can be used across a wide variety of different kinds of content. As long as a source can be turned into text,[V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-016) you can add layers of highlighting in any information management tool you use.  
渐进式摘要可用于各种不同类型的内容。只要源代码可以转换为文本, [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-016) 你就可以在你使用的任何信息管理工具中添加高亮层。

Let’s look at more examples of progressively summarized notes:  
让我们看看更多渐进式总结笔记的例子:

#### Wikipedia Articles 维基百科文章

Have you ever found yourself visiting the same Wikipedia article again and again or trying to remember something from that one article you read weeks ago?  
您是否发现自己一次又一次地访问同一篇维基百科文章, 或者试图记住您几周前阅读的那篇文章中的内容?

By saving the best excerpts from Wikipedia articles you read, you can create your own private encyclopedia with only the parts that are most relevant to you. In the note below, I captured a few key sentences from the article explaining “Baumol’s Cost Disease,” a somewhat esoteric term from economics that I’d seen referenced a few times.  
通过保存您阅读过的维基百科文章的最佳摘录, 您可以创建自己的私人百科全书, 只包含与您最相关的部分。在下面的注释中, 我摘录了解释 “鲍莫尔成本病” 的文章中的几个关键句子, 这是一个经济学中有点深奥的术语, 我曾多次看到它被引用过。

When I first captured the note, I didn’t have time to add tags, highlights, or an executive summary of my own. I saved it to a resource folder for “Economics” to revisit later. A few months later, when it came up in a search for “wages,” I took a few moments to bold a couple of key sentences and highlight the most important one, so I could get the gist of it with a glance.  
当我第一次记录笔记时, 我没有时间添加标签、亮点或我自己的执行摘要。我将它保存到 “经济学” 的资源文件夹中, 以便稍后重新访问。几个月后, 当它出现在搜索 “工资” 时, 我花了一些时间将 几个关键句子加粗并突出显示最重要的句子, 这样我一眼就能明白它的要点.

I was once on a panel when one of the speakers mentioned this term. Within the ten seconds before it was my turn to respond, I was able to run a search, look up this note on my tablet (where all my notes are synchronized), and speak confidently on the subject as if I had known it all along.  
当一位发言人提到这个词时, 我曾经在一个小组中。在轮到我回答之前的十秒内, 我能够进行搜索, 在我的平板电脑上查找这条笔记 (我所有的笔记都同步了), 然后自信地谈论这个话题, 就好像我一直都知道一样.

#### Online Articles 在线文章

Much of the time we consume information without a specific purpose in mind. We might peruse the newspaper over breakfast, listen to a podcast while working out, or check out a newsletter to casually learn about a topic. We consume information to stay up to date, pass the time, entertain ourselves, and keep our minds engaged.  
很多时候, 我们在没有特定目的的情况下消费信息。我们可能会在早餐时仔细阅读报纸, 在锻炼时收听播客, 或者查看时事通讯以随意了解某个主题。我们消费信息是为了了解最新信息、打发时间、娱乐自己并保持专注。

These moments are some of the most valuable opportunities to capture tidbits of insight that you probably might not find otherwise. Because this casual reading and listening tends to range over a wide number of topics and interests, you are exposed to more diverse ideas than usual.  
这些时刻是捕捉您可能无法通过其他方式获得的洞察力的一些最宝贵的机会。因为这种随意的阅读和聆听往往涉及广泛的主题和兴趣, 所以你会比平时接触到更多不同的想法。

One evening I was reading an online article that I saw shared on social media. The article explained how Google used “structured interviews” as part of their hiring process to reduce bias, ensure consistency, and learn from past hires. I was a solo freelancer at the time and had no immediate use for knowledge about hiring practices. I knew that someday I might, so I decided to save the paragraph you see below to my Second Brain.  
一天晚上, 我正在阅读一篇在社交媒体上分享的在线文章。这篇文章解释了谷歌如何在招聘过程中使用 “结构化 interviews” 来减少偏见、确保一致性并从过去的招聘中学习。当时我是一名独立的自由职业者, 并没有立即使用有关招聘实践的知识。我知道有一天我会的, 所以我决定把你在下面看到的这段话保存到我的第二大脑中。

Almost two years later, I was finally ready to hire my first employee. I remember the feeling of anxiety as I prepared to take on this major financial commitment, not to mention the responsibility of managing a direct report. Luckily, I had a handful of highly actionable notes saved in a resource folder called “Hiring.” To get started, I moved the entire folder from resources to projects. Then I spent about thirty minutes to review the notes it contained and highlight the most relevant takeaways. Those highlights were the starting point for the hiring process I ended up using for my own business, inspired by one of the most innovative and desirable employers in the world.  
差不多两年后, 我终于准备好雇用我的第一位员工了。我记得当我准备承担这项重大财务承诺时的焦虑感, 更不用说管理直接下属的责任了。幸运的是, 我在名为 “招聘” 的资源文件夹中保存了一些高度可操作的笔记。首先, 我将整个文件夹从资源移动到项目。然后我花了大约三十分钟来回顾它包含的注释并突出显示最相关的要点。这些亮点是我最终用于自己企业的招聘流程的起点, 灵感来自世界上最具创新性和最理想的雇主之一。

#### Podcasts and Audio 播客和音频

Notes can come in handy even when you’re not able to write them down in real time. I was driving with my wife one weekend to a small Airbnb cabin in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, and we decided to listen to a podcast. It was a casual conversation between the host and a course instructor named Meghan Telpner, who ran an online school called the Academy of Culinary Nutrition.[5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn5)  
即使您无法实时记下笔记, 笔记也能派上用场。一个周末, 我和我的妻子开车去加利福尼亚州内华达山脉的 小型 Airbnb 小屋, 我们决定收听播客。这是主持人与一位名叫梅根 · 特尔普纳 (Meghan Telpner) 的课程讲师之间的随意对话, 他经营着一家名为烹饪营养学院的在线学校。 [5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn5)

I had never heard of her and put on the episode without any particular goal in mind. Over the next hour, as we ascended the steep mountainside roads, we were captivated by the story of the education business she had managed to build. She had faced so many of the same challenges we had. It was a relief to hear that we weren’t alone in our struggles. I was driving and unable to write anything down, but as soon as we arrived I sat in the car for a few minutes and captured the ideas I remembered. This is actually a great way to filter down the volume of notes you’re taking—the best stuff always sticks in your mind for an hour or two.  
我从来没有听说过她, 并且在没有任何特定目标的情况下穿上了这一集。在接下来的一个小时里, 当我们登上陡峭的山腰道路时, 我们被她成功建立的教育事业的故事所吸引。她曾面临过许多与我们相同的挑战。听到我们并不孤单, 这让我松了一口气。我当时在开车, 无法写下任何东西, 但我们一到, 我就在车里坐了几分钟, 记下了我记得的想法。这实际上是减少笔记数量的好方法——最好的东西总是会在你的脑海中停留一两个小时。

A few months later, we were preparing a launch campaign for a new version of our online course. I had only a couple of weeks to prepare for it—definitely not enough time to do more research. I had to make use of the ideas I’d already collected. As part of my preparation, I went through this note (which I found within an area folder for “Online education”) and bolded the parts that most resonated with me. Then just before our launch kickoff I highlighted the parts I wanted to apply to our own situation. The highlighted passages you see here were the sparks that eventually led to us hiring alumni of the course to coach new students. This freed up my time to implement another idea from Telpner’s interview: adding a new “executive” coaching tier. You truly never know where inspiration will come from and the extraordinary impact it can have.  
几个月后, 我们正在为新版在线课程准备启动活动。我只有几周的准备时间——绝对没有足够的时间做更多的研究。我必须利用我已经收集的想法。作为我准备工作的一部分, 我仔细阅读了这篇笔记 (我在“在线教育” 的区域文件夹中找到了它), 并将最能引起我共鸣的部分加粗。然后就在我们的发布开始之前, 我突出显示了我想应用到我们自己的情况的部分。您在此处看到的突出显示的段落是最终导致我们聘请该课程的校友来指导新学生的火花。这让我腾出了时间来实施 Telpner 采访中的另一个想法: 增加一个新的 “执行” 教练层级。你真的永远不知道灵感会从何而来, 也不知道它会产生非凡的影响。

Like many people, I spend a fair percentage of my time on phone calls and in meetings. I want to make the best use of that time, so I take notes during most meetings of new ideas, suggestions, feedback, and action steps that come up.  
和许多人一样, 我将相当一部分时间花在打电话和开会上。我想充分利用这段时间, 所以我会在大多数会议上记录新想法、建议、反馈和出现的行动步骤。

Taking notes during meetings is a common practice, but it’s often not clear what we should do with those notes. They are often messy, with the action items buried among random comments. I often use Progressive Summarization to summarize my notes after phone calls to make sure I’m extracting every bit of value from them.  
在会议期间做笔记是一种常见的做法, 但通常不清楚我们应该如何处理这些笔记。它们通常是杂乱无章的, 行动项目隐藏在随意的评论中。我经常在通话后使用渐进式总结来总结我的笔记, 以确保我从中提取了每一点价值。

I captured this note during a conversation with a friend of mine who has experience designing recording studios. We were remodeling our garage into a home studio and I wanted to get his advice. He was kind enough to come over and walk me through his recommendations, and I wrote down the main points in a notes app on my smartphone as he spoke.  
我在与一位有录音室设计经验的朋友的谈话中记下了这个笔记。我们正在将我们的车库改造成一个家庭工作室, 我想听听他的建议。他很友好地走过来向我介绍他的建议, 我在他说话的同时在智能手机上的笔记应用程序中记下了要点。

Sometime later, I happened to be driving by the local hardware store on my way home. I realized that I could pop in and get some of the supplies my friend had recommended. I took out my smartphone, did a search for “home studio,” and found this note. I took a few minutes while sitting in the car and bolded the items I would need to purchase at some point, which were buried among other suggestions he had made.  
一段时间后, 我在回家的路上碰巧路过当地的五金店。我意识到我可以进去买一些我朋友推荐的用品。我拿出智能手机, 搜索 “家庭工作室”, 找到了这张便条。我坐在车里花了几分钟时间, 将我需要在某个时候购买的物品加粗, 这些物品被他提出的其他建议所掩盖。

Here’s what it looked like: 这是它的样子:

I then copied and pasted only the bolded items I was ready to purchase into a separate list below my original notes, and suddenly I had a convenient shopping list I could easily reference while browsing the store.  
然后我只复制并粘贴我准备购买的粗体项目到我原始笔记下方的单独列表中, 突然我有了一个方便的购物清单, 我可以在浏览商店时轻松参考。

This example illustrates how even Progressively Summarizing notes from our own conversations can be immensely useful. Often your own thoughts need some distillation before you can take action on them.  
这个例子说明了从我们自己的对话中逐步总结笔记是如何非常有用的。在您对它们采取行动之前, 您自己的想法通常需要一些提炼。

### Picasso’s Secret: Prune the Good to Surface the Great  
毕加索的秘密: 剔除美好, 浮现伟大

We can look at masters of creativity throughout history to see how distilling their ideas shaped their work.  
我们可以看看历史上的创造力大师, 看看他们的想法如何塑造他们的作品。

One of Pablo Picasso’s most famous drawings, created in 1945 and known as _Picasso’s Bull_, offers a master class in how distillation works. It is a sequence of images that he drew to study a bull’s essential form. The process of distillation happens in every art form, but this example is unusual in that Picasso preserved each step of his process.  
巴勃罗 · 毕加索 (Pablo Picasso) 最著名的画作之一, 创作于 1945 年, 被称为毕加索的公牛 (Picasso's Bull), 提供有关蒸馏工作原理的大师班。 这是他为研究公牛的基本形态而画的一系列图像。蒸馏的过程发生在每一种艺术形式中, 但这个例子是不寻常的, 因为毕加索保留了他的过程的每一步。

Pablo Picasso, _Le Taureau_ (series of 11 lithographs), 1945–46 (© 2021 Estate of Pablo Picasso / Artists Rights Society (ARS), New York).  
巴勃罗毕加索, Le Taureau(系列 11 幅石版画),1945–46(© 2021 Estate of Pablo Picasso / Artists Rights Society (ARS), 纽约)。

Starting with the top left image and moving across and down, Picasso deconstructed the shapes of the bull one step at a time. In the first couple of drawings, he adds more detail. The horns are fuller, the tail becomes three-dimensional, and the hide has more depth and texture. Picasso is starting by building up detail so that he has more options to choose from when it comes time to take some away.  
从左上角的图像开始, 毕加索一步一步地解构公牛的形状。在前几幅图中, 他添加了更多细节。牛角更饱满, 尾巴变得立体, 皮革更有深度和 纹理。毕加索从建立细节开始, 这样当他需要拿走一些东西时, 他就有更多的选择。

The process of distillation begins with the fourth image. He outlines the main muscles of the animal using sharp white lines. Soft curves become more angular, and the animal as a whole starts to take on a more geometric look. In the fifth and sixth images, the drawing starts to become radically simplified as Picasso drops most of the detail in the bull’s head and further simplifies its horns, tail, and legs. A thick white line representing the bull’s center of gravity is added, cutting across the animal from front to back.  
蒸馏过程从第四张图片开始。他用清晰的白线勾勒出动物的主要肌肉。柔和的曲线变得更有棱角, 整个动物开始呈现出更几何的外观。在第五张和第六张图片中, 由于毕加索放弃了公牛头部的大部分细节, 并进一步简化了它的角、尾巴和腿, 这幅画开始变得彻底简化。添加了一条代表公牛重心的粗白线, 从前到后横切该动物。

By the last few images, the bull has become nothing more than an interconnected series of simple, black-and-white shapes. The legs have become single lines. Solid blocks of color define the front and back of the animal. In the final drawings, even those details are abstracted away. We end with a drawing that is nothing but a single, continuous stroke, which somehow still manages to capture the very essence of the bull.[6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn6)  
通过最后几张图片, 公牛只不过是一系列相互关联的简单黑白形状。腿变成了单线。实心色块定义了动物的正面和背面。在最终的图纸中, 甚至那些细节都被抽象掉了。我们以一幅画作结尾, 它只不过是一个单一的、连续的笔画, 不知怎的, 它仍然设法抓住了公牛的本质。 [6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch06fn6)

Picasso’s act of distillation involves stripping away the unnecessary so that only the essential remains. Crucially, Picasso couldn’t have started with the single line drawing. He needed to go through each layer of the bull’s form step-by-step to absorb the proportions and shapes into his muscle memory. The result points to a mysterious aspect of the creative process: it can end up with a result that looks so simple, it seems like anyone could have made it. That simplicity masks the effort that was needed to get there.  
毕加索的提炼行为包括去除不必要的东西, 只留下最重要的东西。至关重要的是, 毕加索不可能从单线画开始。他需要一步步经历公牛形态的每一层, 将比例和形状吸收到他的肌肉记忆中。结果指向了创作过程的一个神秘方面: 它最终可能会得到一个看起来如此简单的结果, 似乎任何人都可以做到。这种简单掩盖了到达那里所需的努力。

Another example comes from documentary filmmaking. Ken Burns, the renowned creator of award-winning films like _The Civil War_, _Baseball_, and _Jazz_, has said that only a tiny percentage of the raw footage he captures eventually makes it into the final cut. This ratio can be as high as 40- or 50-to-1, which means that for every forty to fifty hours of footage he captures, only one hour makes it into the final film. Along the way, Burns and his team are performing a radical act of distillation—finding the most interesting, surprising, moving moments hidden amidst hundreds of hours of recordings.[VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-015)  
另一个例子来自纪录片制作。肯 · 伯恩斯 (Ken Burns) 是《内战》、《棒球》和《爵士乐》等获奖影片的著名创作者, 他曾表示, 他拍摄的原始镜头中只有一小部分最终会进入最终剪辑。这个比例可以高达 40 比 1 或 50 比 1, 这意味着对于他拍摄的每 40 到 50 小时的镜头, 只有一个小时进入了​​ final 电影。在此过程中, 伯恩斯和他的团队正在进行一项激进的提炼行动——找到隐藏在数百小时录音中的最有趣、最令人惊讶、最感人的时刻。 [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-015)

Progressive Summarization is not a method for remembering as much as possible—it is a method for forgetting as much as possible. As you distill your ideas, they naturally improve, because when you drop the merely good parts, the great parts can shine more brightly. To be clear, it takes skill and courage to let the details fall away. As Picasso’s bull and Burns’s documentaries illustrate, in making decisions about what to keep, we inevitably have to make decisions about what to throw away. You cannot highlight the main takeaways from an article without leaving some points out. You cannot make a highlight reel of a video without cutting some of the footage. You cannot give an effective presentation without leaving out some slides.  
渐进式总结不是一种尽可能多地记住的方法——它是一种尽可能多地忘记的方法。当你提炼你的想法时, 它们自然会得到改善, 因为当你放下仅仅好的部分时, 伟大的部分会更加闪耀。需要明确的是, 让细节消失需要技巧和勇气。正如毕加索的公牛和伯恩斯的纪录片所说明的那样, 在决定保留什么的同时, 我们不可避免地要决定扔掉什么。你不能在不遗漏一些要点的情况下突出文章的主要内容。如果不剪切某些素材, 就无法制作视频的精彩片段。如果不遗漏一些幻灯片, 就无法进行有效的演示。

### The Three Most Common Mistakes of Novice Notetakers  
记笔记新手最常犯的三个错误

Here are a few guidelines to help you avoid common pitfalls as you embark on highlighting your own notes.  
以下是一些指南, 可帮助您在着手突出显示自己的笔记时避免常见的陷阱。

#### Mistake #1: Over-Highlighting 错误 #1: 过度突出显示

The biggest mistake people make when they start to distill their notes is that they highlight way too much. You may have experienced this pitfall in school, highlighting paragraph after paragraph or entire pages of textbooks in the vain hope that you’d automatically be able to remember everything in yellow for the test.  
人们在开始提炼笔记时犯的最大错误是他们突出了太多。您可能在学校遇到过这种陷阱, 逐段或整个 pages 教科书突出显示, 徒劳地希望您能够自动记住黄色的所有内容以进行测试。

When it comes to notetaking for work, less is more. You can capture entire books, articles with dozens of pages, or social media posts by the hundreds. No one will stop you, but you’ll quickly learn that such volume will only create a lot more work later on when you have to figure out what all that information means. If you’re going to capture everything, you might as well capture nothing.  
说到工作笔记, 少即是多。您可以捕获整本书、数十页的文章或数百个社交媒体帖子。没有人会阻止你, 但你会很快了解到, 当你必须弄清楚所有这些信息的含义时, 这样的数量只会在以后产生更多的工作。如果您要捕获所有内容, 则还不如什么都不捕获。

Remember that notes are not authoritative texts. You don’t need to and shouldn’t include every tiny detail. They are more like bookmarks peeking out from the pages of a book on the shelf, signaling to you, “Hey! There’s something interesting here!” You will always be able to go back and review the full, original source if needed. Your notes only solve the problem of rediscovering those sources when you need them.  
请记住, 注释不是权威文本。你不需要也不应该包括每一个微小的细节。它们更像是书签, 从书架上的书页中探出头来, 向你发出信号,“嘿! 这里有什么有趣的东西!” 如果需要, 您将始终能够返回并查看完整的原始来源。您的笔记只解决了在您需要时重新发现这些资源的问题。

A helpful rule of thumb is that each layer of highlighting should include no more than 10–20 percent of the previous layer. If you save a series of excerpts from a book amounting to five hundred words, the bolded second layer should include no more than one hundred words, and highlighted third layer no more than twenty. This isn’t an exact science, but if you find yourself highlighting everything, this rule should give you pause.  
一个有用的经验法则是, 每一层高亮显示不应超过前一层的 10-20%。如果你保存一本书的一系列节选, 总计五百字, 加粗的第二层不应超过一百字, 突出显示的第三层不应超过二十字。这不是一门精确的科学, 但如果你发现自己要突出显示所有内容, 这条规则应该会让你停下来。

#### Mistake #2: Highlighting Without a Purpose in Mind  
错误 #2: 没有目的的突出显示

The most common question I hear about Progressive Summarization is “When should I be doing this highlighting?” The answer is that you should do it _when you’re getting ready to create something._  
我听到的关于渐进式总结的最常见问题是 “我应该什么时候进行突出显示?” 答案是当你准备好创造一些东西时你应该这样做。

Unlike Capture and Organize, which take mere seconds, it takes time and effort to distill your notes. If you try to do it with every note up front, you’ll quickly be mired in hours of meticulous highlighting with no clear purpose in mind. You can’t afford such a giant investment of time without knowing whether it will pay off.  
与只需几秒钟的捕获和整理不同, 提炼您的笔记需要时间和精力。如果您尝试在前面的每个音符 上都这样做, 您很快就会陷入数小时的细致突出显示而没有明确的目的。在不知道是否会得到回报的情况下, 您无法承担如此巨大的时间投资。

Instead, wait until you know how you’ll put the note to use. For example, when I’m preparing to write a blog post or article, I’ll usually start by highlighting the most interesting points from a group of notes that I think will be relevant to the topic at hand. That way I have a predictable, not-too-difficult task to get me warmed up for writing, the same way an athlete might have a warm-up and stretching routine.  
相反, 等到你知道如何使用笔记。例如, 当我准备写一篇博文或文章时, 我通​​常会从我认为与手头主题相关的一组笔记中突出显示最有趣的点。这样我就有了一个可预测的、不太困难的任务来让我为写作热身, 就像运动员可能有热身和伸展运动一样。

When I’m about to get on a call with my lawyer, I’ll often prepare by highlighting my notes from our last call and drawing out decision points and action items into an agenda. He always thinks I’m well prepared, when in fact I just want to finish the call quickly to minimize the time I’m being billed for!  
当我要与我的律师通话时, 我通常会通过突出显示上次通话中的笔记并将决策点和行动项目绘制到议程中来做好准备。他总是认为我准备充分, 而实际上我只是想尽快结束通话, 以尽量减少我被计费的时间!

You have to always assume that, until proven otherwise, any given note won’t necessarily ever be useful. You have no idea what your future self will need, want, or be working on. This assumption forces you to be conservative in the time you spend summarizing notes, doing so only when it’s virtually guaranteed that it will be worth it.  
您必须始终假设, 除非另有证明, 否则任何给定的注释都不一定有用。你不知道未来的自己需要什么、想要什么或正在从事什么。这种假设迫使你在花时间总结笔记时要保守, 只有在几乎可以保证这样做是值得的时候才这样做。

The rule of thumb to follow is that every time you “touch” a note, you should make it a little more discoverable for your future self[VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-014)—by adding a highlight, a heading, some bullets, or commentary. This is the “campsite rule” applied to information—leave it better than you found it. This ensures that the notes you interact with most often will naturally become the most discoverable in a virtuous cycle.  
要遵循的经验法则是, 每次你 “触摸” 一个笔记时, 你应该让你未来的自己 [VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-014) 更容易发现它——通过添加高亮、标题、一些项目符号或评论。这是适用于信息的 “营地规则”——留下它比你 找到它更好。这确保了您最常交互的笔记自然会成为良性循环中最容易被发现的笔记。

#### Mistake #3: Making Highlighting Difficult  
错误 #3: 难以突出显示

Don’t worry about analyzing, interpreting, or categorizing each point to decide whether to highlight it. That is way too taxing and will break the flow of your concentration. Instead, rely on your intuition to tell you when a passage is interesting, counterintuitive, or relevant to your favorite problems or a current project.  
不要担心分析、解释或分类每个点来决定是否突出显示它。那太费力了, 会打断你的注意力。相反, 当一段话有趣、违反直觉或与你最喜欢的问题或当前项目相关时, 依靠你的直觉来告诉你。

Just as you listened for a feeling of internal resonance in deciding what content to save in the first place, the same rule applies for the insights _within_ the note. Certain passages will move you, pique your attention, make your heart beat faster, or provoke you. Those are clear signals that you’ve found something important, and it’s time to add a highlight. You can apply the same criteria I introduced earlier in Chapter 4, looking out for individual points that are surprising, useful, inspiring, or personal to decide which ones are worth highlighting.  
正如您在决定首先保存哪些内容时聆听内部共鸣的感觉一样, 同样的规则适用于笔记中的见解。某些段落会打动您、引起您的注意、让您心跳加速或激怒您。这些都是您发现重要内容的明确信号, 是时候添加亮点了。您可以应用我在第 4 章前面介绍的相同标准, 寻找令人惊讶、有用、鼓舞人心或个人的个人要点, 以决定哪些值得强调。

When you learn the art of distillation, you will gain a lifelong skill that will impact every area of your life. Think of a storyteller who captivates you with every word. Their story is well distilled, with unnecessary details stripped away. Think about the last time you were entranced by a drawing or painting. Its ability to grab you immediately is a sign that the concept behind the artwork is compressed into its most compact form, allowing it to travel efficiently from the canvas straight into your brain.  
当您学习蒸馏的艺术时, 您将获得终生受益的技能, 它将影响您生活的方方面面。想想一个讲故事的人, 他的每一个字都让你着迷。他们的故事提炼得很好, 去掉了不必要的细节。回想一下您上一次被一幅图画或绘画所吸引的情景。它能够立即吸引您, 这表明艺术品背后的概念被压缩成最紧凑的形式, 使其能够从画布上高效地直接进入您的大脑。

Even in our daily conversations, the ability to be succinct without missing key details is what leads to exciting conversations that leave both people feeling enlivened. Distillation is at the heart of the communication that is so central to our friendships, our working relationships, and our leadership abilities. Notetaking gives you a way to deliberately practice the skill of distilling every day.  
即使在我们的日常对话中, 能够在不遗漏关键细节的情况下保持简洁, 也会导致令人兴奋的对话, 让双方都感到活跃。提炼是沟通的核心, 这对我们的友谊、我们的工作 关系和我们的领导能力至关重要。做笔记让你有意识地练习每天提炼的技巧。

### Your Turn: Keep Your Future Self in Mind  
轮到你了: 牢记未来的自己

The effort we put into Progressive Summarization is meant for one purpose: to make it easy to find and work with our notes in the future.  
我们在 Progressive Summarization 上的努力是为了一个目的: 让我们的笔记在未来更容易找到和使用。

More is not better when it comes to thinking and creating. Distilling makes our ideas small and compact, so we can load them up into our minds with minimal effort. If you can’t locate a piece of information quickly, in a format that’s convenient and ready to be put to use, then you might as well not have it at all. Our most scarce resource is time, which means we need to prioritize our ability to quickly rediscover the ideas that we already have in our Second Brain.  
在思考和创造方面, 并不是越多越好。提炼使我们的想法变得小而紧凑, 因此我们可以毫不费力地将它们加载到我们的脑海中。如果您不能以一种方便且随时可用的格式快速找到一条信息, 那么您还不如根本没有它。我们最稀缺的资源是时间, 这意味着我们需要优先考虑快速重新发现第二大脑中已有想法的能力。

When the opportunity arrives to do our best work, it’s not the time to start reading books and doing research. You need that research to already be done.[VIII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-013) You can prepare in advance for the future challenges and opportunities you don’t even yet know you’ll face, by taking advantage of the effort you’re already spending reading books, learning new things, and simply being curious about the world around you.  
当我们有机会做到最好时, 不是开始读书和做研究的时候。您需要已经完成该研究。 [VIII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-013) 你可以提前为你甚至还不知道你将面临的未来挑战和机遇做好准备, 方法是利用你已经花在阅读书籍上的努力, 学习新事物, 并且只是对你周围的世界。

To put what you’ve just learned into practice immediately, find an interesting piece of content you consumed recently, such as an article, audiobook, or YouTube video. This could be content you’ve captured already and organized in one of your PARA folders. Or it could be a new piece of content floating around your email inbox or in a read later app.  
要立即将刚刚学到的知识付诸实践, 请找到最近消费的有趣内容, 例如文章、有声读物或 YouTube 视频。这可能是您已经捕获并组织在您的某个 PARA 文件夹中的内容。或者它可能是漂浮在您的电子邮件收件箱或稍后阅读应用程序中的新内容。

Start by saving only the best excerpts from that piece of content in a new note, either using copy-paste or a capture tool. This is layer one, the initial excerpts you save in your Second Brain. Next, read through the excerpts, bolding the main points and most important takeaways. Don’t make it an analytical decision—listen for a feeling of resonance and let that be your guide for what to bold. These bolded passages are layer two.  
首先, 使用复制粘贴或捕捉工具, 仅在新笔记中保存该内容的最佳摘录。这是第一层, 您保存在第二大脑中的初始摘录。接下来, 通读摘录, 将要点和最重要的要点加粗。不要让它成为一个分析性的决定——倾听一种共鸣的感觉, 让它成为你大胆尝试的指南。这些加粗的段落是第二层。

Now read through only the bolded passages, and highlight (or, if your notes app doesn’t have a highlighting feature, underline) the best of the best passages. The key here is to be very picky: the entire note may have only a few highlighted sentences, or even just one. Not only is that fine, it represents a highly distilled and discoverable note. These highlights are layer three, which is distilled enough for most use cases.  
现在只通读粗体段落, 并突出显示 (或者, 如果您的笔记应用程序没有突出显示功能, 则在下划线) 最好的段落中的最好的。这里的关键是要非常挑剔: 整个笔记可能只有几个突出显示的句子, 甚至只有一个。不仅如此, 它还代表了一种高度提炼和可发现的音符。这些亮点是第三层, 对于大多数用例来说已经足够了。

The true test of whether a note you’ve created is discoverable is whether you can get the gist of it at a glance. Put it aside for a few days and set a reminder to revisit it once you’ve forgotten most of the details. When you come back to it, give yourself no more than thirty seconds and see if you can rapidly get up to speed on what it’s about using the highlights you previously made. You’ll quickly be able to tell if you’ve added too many highlights or too few.  
对您创建的笔记是否可被发现的真正测试是, 您是否可以一目了然地了解它的要点。将它搁置几天, 并设置一个提醒, 以便在您忘记大部分细节后重新访问它。当你回头看时, 给自己不超过 30 秒的时间, 看看你是否可以使用之前制作的亮点快速了解它的内容。您很快就能判断是添加了太多高光还是太少。

Each time you decide to add a highlight, you are developing your judgment: distinguishing the bits that truly matter from those that don’t. This is a skill you can become better at over time. The more you exercise your judgment, the more efficient and enjoyable your notetaking will become because you know that every minute of attention you invest is creating lasting value. There are few things more satisfying than the feeling of making consistent progress.  
每次你决定添加亮点时, 你都在发展你的判断力: 区分真正重要的部分和不重要的部分。这是一项你可以随着时间的推移变得更好的技能。你越多地运用你的判断力, 你的 notetaking 就会变得越高效和愉快, 因为你知道你投入的每一分钟注意力都在创造持久的价值。没有什么比不断进步的感觉更令人满足的了。

In the next chapter, we will move on to the final step of CODE, drawing on the material you’ve collected and distilled and using it to express your own point of view.  
在下一章中, 我们将继续进行 CODE 的最后一步, 利用您收集和提炼的材料, 并用它来表达您自己的观点。

1.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-019-backlink). I like to think of layer one as the “soil”—an excerpt from a source or my own thinking (whether as words, drawings, images, or audio) I initially capture into my notes. They are like the ground on which my understanding will be built. Layer two is “oil,” as in “I’ve struck oil!,” conveniently represented by black, bolded text. Layer three is “gold,” which is even more valuable, and shines in highlighter yellow in many apps. Layer four is the “gems,” the most rare and illuminating finds that I’ve distilled in my own words as an executive summary.  
    二。我喜欢将第一层视为 “土壤”——我最初捕捉到笔记中的来源或我自己的想法(无论是文字、图画、图像还是音频) 的摘录。它们就像是我理解的基础。第二层是“石油”, 如“我发现石油了!”, 方便地用黑色粗体文本表示。第三层是“黄金”, 它更有价值, 在许多应用程序中闪耀着荧光笔的黄色。第四层是“宝石”, 是我用自己的话提炼出来的最罕见、最有启发性的发现, 作为执行摘要。
2.  [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-018-backlink). In his book _A New Method of Making Common-Place-Books_, John Locke similarly advised that “We extract only those Things which are Choice and Excellent, either for the Matter itself, or else the Elegancy of the Expression, and not what comes next.”  
    三、约翰 · 洛克在他的《制作普通书本的新方法》一书中同样建议,“我们只提取那些精选和优秀的东西, 无论是为了事情本身, 还是为了表达的优雅, 而不是接下来会发生什么”
3.  [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-017-backlink). As humans we are exquisitely sensitive to the way information is presented. In web design, a slight change of color for a button or a slightly reworded headline can easily have a double-digit impact on the number of visitors who click on it. Imagine if we put as much thought into how the information on our own devices is presented to us as we do into the public web. Even something as simple as an informative heading, a paragraph break, or a highlighted phrase can make it dramatically easier to absorb a piece of text.  
    四、作为人类, 我们对信息的呈现方式极为敏感。在网页设计中, 按钮颜色的轻微变化或标题的轻微改写很容易对点击它的访问者数量产生两位数的影响。想象一下, 如果我们像对待公共网络一样, 尽可能多地考虑自己设备上的信息是如何呈现给我们的。即使像信息性标题、段落分隔符或突出显示的短语这样简单的内容也可以使吸收一段文本变得非常容易。
4.  [V](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-016-backlink). Distillation also applies to other kinds of media such as images, audio, and video, but looks quite different and is beyond the scope of this book.  
    诉。蒸馏也适用于其他类型的媒体, 如图像、音频和视频, 但看起来很不一样, 超出了本书的范围。
5.  [VI](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-015-backlink). In a class on documentary filmmaking on the educational platform MasterClass, Burns offered his suggestions for keeping track of material related to a film project: “Is there an article in the newspaper that relates to your project? Cut it out and file it. Have you written a draft of narration or dialogue? Print it out and file it. Thought of some great questions to ask your first interview subject? Jot them down on a scrap of paper and file that too.”  
    六. 在教育平台 MasterClass 上的纪录片制作课程中, 伯恩斯提出了他对跟踪与电影项目相关的材料的建议:“报纸上有与你的项目相关的文章吗? 把它剪下来归档。你写过旁白或对话的草稿吗? 打印出来并存档。想到一些重要的问题来问你的第一个采访对象? 把它们记在一张纸片上, 然后也归档。”
6.  [VII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-014-backlink). This principle is called stigmergy—to leave “marks” on the environment that make your future efforts easier. It is a strategy used by ant colonies to find food. If an ant finds a food source, it will bring a piece of it back to the colony, while leaving a special pheromone along the trail. Other ants can follow this trail to find the food for themselves, enabling a multitude of ants to quickly find and collect new sources of food.  
    七。这个原则被称为耻辱——在环境上留下 “标记”, 使你未来的努力更容易。这是蚁群用来寻找食物的策略。如果一只蚂蚁找到了食物来源, 它会把其中的一部分带回蚁群, 同时在沿途留下一种特殊的信息素。其他蚂蚁可以沿着这条轨迹为自己寻找食物, 使众多蚂蚁能够快速找到并收集新的食物来源。
7.  [VIII](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-013-backlink). As Sönke Ahrens observes in his book _How to Take Smart Notes_, this is the fundamental paradox at the heart of writing: you have to do the research before you know what you will write about. In his words: “We have to read with a pen in hand, develop ideas on paper and build up an ever-growing pool of externalised thoughts. We will not be guided by a blindly made-up plan picked from our unreliable brains, but by our interest, curiosity and intuition, which is formed and informed by the actual work of reading, thinking, discussing, writing and developing ideas—and is something that continuously grows and reflects our knowledge and understanding externally.”  
    八。正如 Sönke Ahrens 在他的《如何做聪明的笔记》一书中所观察到的, 这是写作核心的基本悖论: 在知道要写什么之前, 你必须先做研究。用他的话说:“我们必须手持笔阅读, 在纸上发展想法, 并建立不断增长的外化思想库。我们不会被从我们不可靠的大脑中挑选出来的盲目制定的计划所引导, 而是被我们的兴趣、好奇心和直觉所引导, 这些兴趣、好奇心和直觉是由阅读、思考、讨论、写作和发展想法的实际工作形成和启发的——并且是不断增长并从外部反映我们的知识和理解的东西。”

In June 1947, a baby girl named Octavia Estelle Butler was born in Pasadena, California.  
1947 年 6 月, 一个名叫 Octavia Estelle Butler 的女婴在加利福尼亚州帕萨迪纳出生。

Known in her early years as simply “Estelle,” she was raised by a single, widowed mother who worked domestic jobs to make ends meet. Painfully shy and introverted from a young age, Estelle became an easy target for bullying at school, which led her to believe she was “ugly and stupid, clumsy, socially hopeless.”[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn1) Her shyness combined with mild dyslexia made schoolwork difficult.  
她早年被简称为 “Estelle”, 由一位寡居的单身母亲抚养长大, 母亲从事家政工作以维持生计。埃斯特尔从小就非常害羞内向, 在学校很容易成为欺凌的目标, 这让她认为自己 “又丑又蠢, 笨拙, 在社交上毫无希望”。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn1) 她的害羞加上轻度阅读障碍使功课变得困难。

In response, Estelle turned inward to her own imagination and outward to the Pasadena Central Library, where she would spend countless hours reading fairy tales and horse stories, and later, the fantasy and science-fiction novels that would eventually inspire her to become a writer.  
作为回应, 埃斯特尔向内转向自己的想象力, 向外转向帕萨迪纳中央图书馆, 在那里她会花无数个小时阅读童话故事和马的故事, 后来, 奇幻小说和科幻小说最终激发了她成为一名作家的灵感.

Despite the odds stacked against her, this young woman would eventually become one of the most successful and influential science-fiction writers of her generation, winning multiple Hugo and Nebula awards (the genre’s highest honors) and in 1995 becoming the first sci-fi writer to receive a MacArthur “Genius” Fellowship.  
尽管困难重重, 这位年轻女性最终成为了她那一代最成功和最有影响力的 科幻作家之一, 多次获得雨果奖和星云奖 (该类型的最高荣誉), 并于 1995 年成为第一位科幻作家 - fi 作家获得麦克阿瑟“天才” 奖学金。

But Estelle wasn’t always so successful. Her teachers at Garfield Elementary School evaluated her earliest writing harshly, with comments like “Hyperbolic” and “You’re not even trying” scribbled in the margins.[2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn2) An elementary school teacher once asked, “Why include the science fiction touch? I think the story would be more universal if you kept to the human, earthly touch.” The teacher reported to her mother that “She has the understanding, but doesn’t apply it. She needs to learn self-discipline.”  
但埃斯特尔并不总是那么成功。她在加菲尔德小学的老师严厉地评价了她最早的作品, 在空白处潦草地写下了诸如 “双曲线” 和“你甚至没有尝试”之类的评论。 [2](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn2) 一位小学老师曾问:“为什么要加入科幻元素? 我认为, 如果你保持人性化、世俗化, 这个故事会更具有普遍性。” 老师向她的母亲报告说:“她有理解力, 但没有应用它。她需要学会自律。”

When she was twelve years old, Estelle watched the 1954 film _Devil Girl From Mars_, a sensationalist B movie that was so terrible it convinced Estelle that she could write something better. She recalls, “Until I began writing my own stories, I never found quite what I was looking for... In desperation, I made up my own.”  
埃斯特尔 12 岁时看了 1954 年的电影《来自火星的恶魔女孩》, 这是一部耸人听闻的 B 级电影, 非常糟糕, 它让埃斯特尔相信她可以写出更好的东西。她回忆说,“在我开始写自己的故事之前, 我从来没有找到我想要的东西...... 无奈之下, 我编了自己的故事。”

As the possibility of becoming a professional writer slowly dawned on her, Estelle began her transformation into “Octavia,” whom she thought of as her powerful, assertive alter ego. Octavia took on a series of temporary or part-time jobs after graduating from high school: clerical, factory, warehouse, laundry, and food preparation gigs—anything that wasn’t too mentally taxing, and that allowed her to maintain her routine of waking before dawn each morning to write.  
随着成为一名职业作家的可能性慢慢浮现, 埃斯特尔开始转变为 “奥克塔维亚”, 她认为她是她强大、自信的另一个自我。奥克塔维亚高中毕业后从事了一系列临时或兼职工作: 文员、工厂、仓库、洗衣店和准备食物的工作——任何不太费脑力的工作, 这让她能够保持她每天醒来的习惯每天早上黎明前写作。

The emerging Octavia made three rules for herself:  
崭露头角的 Octavia 为自己制定了三项规则:

1.  Don’t leave your home without a notebook, paper scraps, something to write with.  
    不要在没有笔记本、纸屑和可以用来写字的东西的情况下离开家。
2.  Don’t walk into the world without your eyes and ears focused and open.  
    不要在眼睛和耳朵没有专注和开放的情况下走进这个世界。
3.  Don’t make excuses about what you don’t have or what you would do if you did, use that energy to “find a way, make a way.”  
    不要为你没有的东西或如果你有你会做什么找借口, 用那种能量去 “找到方法, 开辟方法”。

Thus began a lifelong relationship with her commonplace books. Butler would scrape together twenty-five cents to buy small Mead memo pads, and in those pages she took notes on every aspect of her life: grocery and clothes shopping lists, last-minute to-dos, wishes and intentions, and calculations of her remaining funds for rent, food, and utilities. She meticulously tracked her daily writing goals and page counts, lists of her failings and desired personal qualities, her wishes and dreams for the future, and contracts she would sign with herself each day for how many words she committed to write.  
就这样开始了她与平凡书籍的终生关系。 Butler 会凑出 25 美分买小的 Mead 记事本, 在这些记事本上她记下了她生活的方方面面: 杂货和衣服购物清单、最后一分钟的待办事项、愿望和意图, 以及她的计算剩余资金用于租金、食品和水电费。她一丝不苟地记录她每天的写作目标和页数, 列出她的失败和想要的个人品质, 她对未来的愿望和梦想, 以及她每天要与自己签订的关于她承诺写多少字的合同。

Of course, Butler also gathered material for her fantastic stories: lyrics to songs she’d heard on the radio, an idea for a character’s name or motivation, a new topic to research, details of news stories—everything she needed to build the worlds her stories would take place in. She studied dozens of topics—anthropology, English, journalism, and speech. She traveled to the Amazon and Incan ruins in Peru to get a firsthand taste of biodiversity and civilizational collapse. Like a journalist, Butler had a love for cold, hard facts to imbue her stories with a sense of authenticity and concreteness: “The greater your ignorance the more verifiably accurate must be your facts,” she once remarked.  
当然, 巴特勒也为她的奇妙故事收集了材料: 她在收音机里听到的歌曲的歌词、人物名字或动机的想法、要研究的新主题、新闻故事的细节——她构建世界所需的一切她的故事将发生在。她研究了几十个主题——人类学、英语、新闻学和演讲。她前往秘鲁的亚马逊和印加遗址, 亲身体验生物多样性和文明崩溃。就像一名记者一样, 巴特勒喜欢冷酷无情的事实, 使她的故事充满真实感和具体感:“你越无知, 你的事实就越准确,” 她曾经说过。

One of Butler’s novels, _The Parable of the Sower_, hit the _New York Times_ bestseller list for the first time in 2020,[3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn3) fulfilling one of Butler’s life goals fourteen years after her death. The book portrays a postapocalyptic future in the aftermath of runaway climate disasters, in which small communities must band together in order to survive. These eerily prescient forecasts resonated with readers as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded, as our own time began to seem similarly bleak and uncertain. The radical reimagination of what life could look like in the midst of a crisis was no longer idle speculation—it had become a daily preoccupation for people around the world. Butler has been called a prophet for her ability to forecast the future, but she always said that her work came from simply imagining, “If this goes on... it extrapolates from current technology, current ecological conditions, current social conditions, current practices of any sort. It offers good possibilities—as well as warnings.”  
巴特勒的其中一部小说《播种者的寓言》在 2020 年首次登上纽约时报畅销书排行榜, [3](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn3) 在她去世十四年后实现了巴特勒的人生目标之一。这本书描绘了失控的气候灾难过后的世界末日未来, 小社区必须团结起来才能生存。随着 COVID-19 大流行的展开, 这些极具先见之明的预测引起了读者的共鸣, 因为我们自己的时代开始显得同样黯淡和不确定。对 在危机中的生活可能是什么样子的彻底重新想象不再是无聊的猜测——它已经成为世界各地人们每天都在关注的事情。巴特勒因其预测未来的能力而被称为先知, 但她总是说她的工作来自于简单的想象,“如果这种情况继续下去...... 种类。它提供了很好的可能性——以及警告。”

Butler knew that science fiction was more than entertainment. It was a transformative way of viewing the future. As one of the first Black women to gain recognition in the sci-fi genre, Butler explored ideas and themes that had been previously ignored: the potential consequences of environmental collapse due to climate change, corporate greed and the growing gap between the wealthy and poor, gender fluidity and the “othering” of marginalized groups, and criticism of the hierarchical nature of society, among other themes.  
巴特勒知道科幻小说不仅仅是娱乐。这是一种看待未来的变革方式。作为第一批在科幻小说中获得认可的黑人女性之一, 巴特勒探索了以前被忽视的想法和主题: 气候变化导致环境崩溃的潜在后果、企业的贪婪以及日益扩大的贫富差距, 性别流动性和边缘化群体的 “他者化”, 以及对社会等级性质的批评等主题。

Butler pioneered Afrofuturism, a genre that cast African Americans as protagonists who embrace radical change in order to survive. Her stories allowed her readers to visualize futures in which marginalized people are heroes, not victims. Through her writing, she expanded our vision of the future to include the untold stories of the disenfranchised, the outcast, and the unconventional.  
巴特勒开创了非洲未来主义, 这是一种将非裔美国人塑造成主角的流派, 他们为了生存而接受激进的变革。她的故事让她的读者想象未来, 边缘化的人是英雄, 而不是受害者。通过她的写作, 她扩大了我们对未来的视野, 将被剥夺权利者、被遗弃者和非传统者的不为人知的故事包括在内。

How do we know so much about even the tiniest details of Butler’s life? Because she kept it all—journals, commonplace books, speeches, library call slips, essay and story drafts, school notes, calendars, and datebooks as well as assorted odds and ends like school progress reports, bus passes, yearbooks, and contracts. This collection contained 9,062 items and filled 386 boxes when it was donated to the Huntington Library in San Marino, California, after Butler’s passing.[4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn4)  
我们怎么知道巴特勒生活中最细微的细节呢? 因为她保留了一切——日记、普通书籍、演讲稿、图书馆借阅单、论文和故事草稿、学校笔记、日历和记事本, 以及学校进度报告、公车通行证、年鉴和合同等各种零碎物品。在巴特勒去世后, 该馆藏被捐赠给加利福尼亚州圣马力诺的亨廷顿图书馆, 共包含 9,062 件物品并装满了 386 个盒子。 [4](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn4)

How could a painfully shy little girl become a world-renowned, award-winning writer? How could an impoverished and overworked young woman emerge as a powerful prophet of the future? In her own words: “My mother was a maid, my father shined shoes, and I wanted to write science fiction, who was I kidding?”  
一个非常害羞的小女孩怎么能成为世界知名的获奖作家呢? 一个穷困潦倒、劳累过度的年轻女性如何成为未来的强大预言家? 用她自己 的话来说:“妈妈是女仆, 爸爸擦鞋, 我想写科幻小说, 我跟谁开玩笑?”

Butler did it by drawing on her life experience: “The painful, horrifying, the unpleasant things that happen, affect my work more strongly than the pleasant ones. They’re more memorable and more likely to goad me into writing interesting stories.”  
巴特勒通过借鉴她的生活经历做到了这一点:“发生的痛苦、可怕和不愉快的事情对我的工作的影响比愉快的事情更强烈。它们更令人难忘, 更有可能促使我写出有趣的故事。”

She used her notes and her writing to confront her demons: “The biggest obstacle I had to overcome was my own fear and self-doubt—fear that maybe my work really wasn’t good enough, maybe I wasn’t smart enough; maybe the people telling me I couldn’t make it were right.”  
她用她的笔记和她的写作来对抗她的恶魔:“我必须克服的最大障碍是我自己的恐惧和自我怀疑——害怕我的工作可能真的不够好, 也许我不够聪明; 也许那些告诉我我做不到的人是对的。”

She used every bit of insight and detail she could muster from both her daily life and the books she immersed herself in: “Use what you have; even if it seems meager, it may be magic in your hands.” Butler found a way to express her voice and her ideas even when her circumstances made it seem impossible.  
她运用了她从日常生活和她沉浸其中的书籍中所能收集到的每一点洞察力和细节:“使用你所拥有的; 哪怕看起来微不足道, 在你手中也可能是魔法。” 巴特勒找到了一种方式来表达她的声音和想法, 即使她的情况似乎不可能。

The myth of the writer sitting down before a completely blank page, or the artist at a completely blank canvas, is just that—a myth. Professional creatives constantly draw on outside sources of inspiration—their own experiences and observations, lessons gleaned from successes and failures alike, and the ideas of others. If there is a secret to creativity, it is that it _emerges_ from everyday efforts to gather and organize our influences.  
作家坐在完全空白的页面前, 或者艺术家坐在完全空白的画布前的神话, 只是一个神话。专业创意人员不断汲取外部灵感来源——他们自己的经验和观察、从成功和失败中吸取的教训, 以及他人的想法。如果说创造力有什么秘诀, 那就是它源于每天收集和组织我们的影响力的努力。

### How to Protect Your Most Precious Resource  
如何保护您最宝贵的资源

As knowledge workers, attention is our most scarce and precious resource.  
作为知识工作者, 注意力是我们最稀缺和最宝贵的资源。

The creative process is fueled by attention at every step. It is the lens that allows us to make sense of what’s happening, to notice what resources we have at our disposal, and to see the contribution we can make. The ability to intentionally and strategically allocate our attention is a competitive advantage in a distracted world. We have to jealously guard it like a valuable treasure.  
创作过程的每一步都受到关注的推动。它是让我们了解正在发生的事情的镜头, 注意到我们拥有哪些资源, 并看到我们可以 make 做出的贡献。在一个分心的世界中, 有意识地和战略性地分配我们注意力的能力是一种竞争优势。我们必须像珍宝一样小心翼翼地保护它。

You have twenty-four hours in a day, but how many of those hours include your highest-quality attention? Some days are so frenetic and fragmented that you might not have any at all. Attention can be cultivated but also destroyed—by distractions, interruptions, and environments that don’t protect it. The challenge we face in building a Second Brain is how to establish a system for personal knowledge that _frees up_ attention, instead of taking more of it.  
你一天有二十四小时, 但其中有多少小时是你最高质量的注意力? 有些日子如此狂热和支离破碎, 你可能根本没有。注意力可以通过分心、干扰和不保护它的环境来培养, 但也可以被破坏。我们在构建第二大脑时面临的挑战是如何建立一个个人知识系统来释放注意力, 而不是占用更多注意力。

We’ve been taught that it’s important to work “with the end in mind.” We are told that it is our responsibility to deliver results, whether that is a finished product on store shelves, a speech delivered at an event, or a published technical document.  
我们被教导说,“以终为始” 工作很重要。我们被告知, 交付结果是我们的责任, 无论是商店货架上的成品、活动中的演讲, 还是已发布的技术文档。

This is generally good advice, but there is a flaw in focusing only on the final results: all the intermediate work—the notes, the drafts, the outlines, the feedback—tends to be underappreciated and undervalued. The precious attention we invested in producing that in-between work gets thrown away, never to be used again. Because we manage most of our “work-in-process” in our head, as soon as we finish the project and step away from our desks, all that valuable knowledge we worked so hard to acquire dissolves from our memory like a sandcastle washed away by the ocean waves.  
这通常是个好建议, 但只关注最终结果存在一个缺陷: 所有中间工作——笔记、草稿、大纲、反馈——往往被低估和低估。我们投入制作中间作品的宝贵注意力被扔掉了, 永远不会再被使用。因为我们在头脑中管理大部分 “半成品”, 所以一旦我们完成项目并离开办公桌, 我们辛辛苦苦获得的所有宝贵知识就会像沙堡一样从我们的记忆中消失由海浪。

If we consider the focused application of our attention to be our greatest asset as knowledge workers, we can no longer afford to let that intermediate work disappear. If we consider how precious little time we have to produce something extraordinary in our careers, it becomes imperative that we recycle that knowledge back into a system where it can become useful again.  
如果我们认为集中注意力是我们作为知识工作者的最大资产, 那么我们就不能再让这种中间工作消失了。如果我们考虑到在我们的职业生涯中创造出非凡的东西所需要的时间是多么宝贵, 那么我们就必须将这些知识回收到一个可以再次发挥作用的系统中。

What are the knowledge assets you’re creating today that will be most reusable in the future? What are the building blocks that will move forward your projects tomorrow? How can you package up what you know in a form that you’ll be able to revisit it again and again no matter what endeavors you take on in the future?  
您今天创建的知识资产有哪些将来最可重用? 明天将推进您的项目的基石是什么? 你怎么能把你所知道的打包成一种形式, 无论你在未来做出什么努力, 你都可以一次又一次地重新访问它?

The final stage of the creative process, Express, is about refusing to wait until you have everything perfectly ready before you share what you know. It is about expressing your ideas earlier, more frequently, and in smaller chunks to test what works and gather feedback from others. That feedback in turn gets drawn in to your Second Brain, where it becomes the starting point for the next iteration of your work.  
创意过程的最后阶段, 表达, 就是拒绝等到一切都准备就绪后再分享你所知道的。它是关于更早、更频繁地以更小的块表达您的想法, 以测试哪些有效并收集他人的反馈。该反馈反过来会被吸引到您的第二大脑中, 成为您下一次工作迭代的起点。

### Intermediate Packets: The Power of Thinking Small  
中间数据包: 从小思考的力量

The idea of dividing our work into smaller units isn’t new. You’ve probably heard this advice a hundred times: if you’re stuck on a task, break it down into smaller steps.  
将我们的工作分成更小的单元的想法并不新鲜。你可能已经听过这个建议一百遍了: 如果你被困在一个任务上, 把它分解成更小的步骤。

Every profession and creative medium has its own version of “intermediate steps” on the way to full-fledged final works. For example:  
在通往成熟最终作品的道路上, 每个专业和创意媒体都有自己版本的 “中间步骤”。例如:

*   “Modules” in software development  
    软件开发中的 “模块”
*   “Betas” tested by start-ups 初创企业测试的 “贝塔”
*   “Sketches” in architecture 建筑中的 “草图”
*   “Pilots” for television series 电视连续剧的 “飞行员”
*   “Prototypes” made by engineers 工程师制作的 “原型”
*   “Concept cars” in auto design 汽车设计中的 “概念车”
*   “Demos” in music recording 音乐录音中的 “小样”

Each of these terms is the equivalent of a “rough draft” you create as part of the process of making something new.  
这些术语中的每一个都相当于您在制作新事物的过程中创建的 “草稿”。

Here’s what most people miss: it’s not enough to simply divide tasks into smaller pieces—you then need a _system_ for managing those pieces. Otherwise, you’re just creating a lot of extra work for yourself trying to keep track of them.  
这是大多数人所忽略的: 简单地将任务分成更小的部分是不够的——你还需要一个系统来管理这些部分。否则, 您只是在为自己跟踪它们而做很多额外的工作。

That system is your Second Brain, and the small pieces of work-in-process it contains I call “Intermediate Packets.” Intermediate Packets are the concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-012) For example, a set of notes from a team meeting, a list of relevant research findings, a brainstorm with collaborators, a slide deck analyzing the market, or a list of action items from a conference call. Any note can potentially be used as an Intermediate Packet in some larger project or goal.  
这个系统就是你的第二大脑, 它包含的小块半成品我称之为 “中间数据包”。中间数据包是构成您的工作的具体的、独立的构建块。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-012) 例如, 团队会议的一组笔记、相关研究结果的列表、与合作者的头脑风暴、分析市场的幻灯片或电话会议的行动项目列表。任何笔记都可能用作某个较大项目或目标中的中间包。

Think of a salesperson planning a new campaign for a health-branded energy drink. Sales might seem like the kind of job that is least related to “knowledge management.” Isn’t it all about making calls, having meetings, sending pitches, and closing deals?  
想一想销售人员正在为一种健康品牌的能量饮料策划一项新的活动。销售似乎是与 “知识管理” 关系最少的工作。这不就是打电话、开会、发送推介和完成交易吗?

If we take a closer look, there are many building blocks such a sales job relies on. The company brochure, the sales prospectus, the cold-calling scripts, the list of warm leads, notes from past calls with an important distributor—these are the assets that a salesperson depends on for their performance.  
如果我们仔细观察, 就会发现这样的销售工作依赖于许多构建模块。公司宣传册、销售说明书、推销电话脚本、热情线索清单、过去与重要经销商通话的记录——这些都是销售人员取得业绩所依赖的资产。

Like LEGO blocks, the more pieces you have, the easier it is to build something interesting. Imagine that instead of starting your next project with a blank slate, you started with a set of building blocks—research findings, web clippings, PDF highlights, book notes, back-of-the-envelope sketches—that represent your long-term effort to make sense of your field, your industry, and the world at large.  
就像乐高积木一样, 您拥有的积木越多, 就越容易拼出有趣的东西。想象一下, 您不是从一张白纸开始您的下一个项目, 而是从一组构建块开始——研究发现、网络剪报、PDF 亮点、书本笔记、信封背面草图——它们代表了您的长期努力了解您的领域、您的行业和整个世界。

Our time and attention are scarce, and it’s time we treated the things we invest in—reports, deliverables, plans, pieces of writing, graphics, slides—as knowledge assets that can be reused instead of reproducing them from scratch. Reusing Intermediate Packets of work frees up our attention for higher-order, more creative thinking. Thinking _small_ is the best way to elevate your horizons and expand your ambitions.  
我们的时间和注意力是稀缺的, 是时候将我们投资的东西——报告、可交付成果、计划、文章、图形、幻灯片——视为可以重复使用的知识资产, 而不是从头开始复制它们。重复使用中间的工作包可以释放我们的注意力, 让我们进行更高层次、更具创造性的思考。从小处着想是提升视野和扩大抱负的最佳方式。

There are five kinds of Intermediate Packets you can create and reuse in your work:  
您可以在工作中创建和重用五种中间包:

*   **Distilled notes:** Books or articles you’ve read and distilled so it’s easy to get the gist of what they contain (using the Progressive Summarization technique you learned in the previous chapter, for example).  
    提炼笔记: 您阅读和提炼的书籍或文章, 因此很容易了解它们包含的内容的要点 (例如, 使用您在上一章中学到的渐进式摘要技术)。
*   **Outtakes:** The material or ideas that didn’t make it into a past project but could be used in future ones.  
    Outtakes: 没有在过去的项目中使用但可以在未来的项目中使用的材料或想法。
*   **Work-in-process:** The documents, graphics, agendas, or plans you produced during past projects.  
    半成品: 您在过去的项目中制作的文档、图形、议程或计划。
*   **Final deliverables:** Concrete pieces of work you’ve delivered as part of past projects, which could become components of something new.  
    最终可交付成果: 作为过去项目的一部分, 您交付的具体工作可能会成为新项目的组成部分。
*   **Documents created by others:** Knowledge assets created by people on your team, contractors or consultants, or even clients or customers, that you can reference and incorporate into your work.  
    他人创建的文档: 由您的团队成员、承包商或顾问, 甚至客户创建的知识资产, 您可以参考这些知识资产并将其纳入您的工作中。

If you’re reading how-to articles in your free time, you can save the best tips in your notes and turn them into _distilled notes_ for when it’s time to put them to use. If you’re writing an essay and decide to cut a paragraph, you can save those _outtakes_ in case you ever write a follow-up. If you are in product development and create a detailed set of requirements, you can save that _work-in-process_ as a template for future products. If you’re a management consultant, you can save the slides you presented to an executive team as a _final deliverable_, and reuse them for similar presentations. If you’re a lab scientist and a colleague designs the perfect lab protocol, you can reuse and improve that _document_ for your own use (with their permission, of course).  
如果您在空闲时间阅读操作方法文章, 则可以将最好的提示保存在笔记中, 并将它们转化为提炼的笔记, 以备不时之需。如果你正在写一篇文章并决定删掉一段, 你可以保存那些删减的部分, 以备你写后续文章时使用。如果您正在进行产品开发并创建了一组详细的 of 需求, 您可以将该半成品保存为未来产品的模板。如果您是一名管理顾问, 您可以将您展示给执行团队的幻灯片保存为最终可交付成果, 并在类似的演示中重复使用它们。如果您是一名实验室科学家, 并且您的同事设计了完美的实验室协议, 您可以重复使用和改进该文档供您自己使用 (当然要征得他们的许可)。

You should always cite your sources and give credit where credit is due. A scientist doesn’t obscure her sources—she points to them so others can retrace her footsteps. We all stand on the shoulders of giants, and it’s smart to build on the thinking they’ve done rather than try to reinvent the wheel.  
您应该始终引用您的来源并在信用到期时给予信用。科学家不会掩盖她的来源——她会指出这些来源, 以便其他人可以追溯她的足迹。我们都站在巨人的肩膀上, 明智的做法是建立在他们已经做过的想法上, 而不是试图重新发明轮子。

Making the shift to working in terms of Intermediate Packets unlocks several very powerful benefits.  
转变为以中间包的形式工作可以解锁几个非常强大的好处。

First, you’ll become interruption-proof because you are focusing only on one small packet at a time, instead of trying to load up the entire project into your mind at once. You become less vulnerable to interruptions, because you’re not trying to manage all the work-in-process in your head.  
首先, 你会变得不会被打扰, 因为你一次只关注一个小包, 而不是试图一次将整个项目加载到你的脑海中。你变得不那么容易受到干扰, 因为你不再试图在脑海中管理所有正在进行的工作。

Second, you’ll be able to make progress in any span of time. Instead of waiting until you have multiple uninterrupted hours—which, let’s face it, is rare and getting rarer—you can look at how many minutes you have free and choose to work on an IP that you can get done within that time, even if it’s tiny. Big projects and goals become less intimidating because you can just keep breaking them down into smaller and smaller pieces, until they fit right into the gaps in your day.  
其次, 您将能够在任何时间跨度内取得进步。与其等到你有多个不受打扰的时间——让我们面对现实吧, 这种情况很少见, 而且越来越少——你可以看看你有多少分钟的空闲时间, 然后选择你可以在这段时间内完成的 IP, 即使它很小。大项目和目标变得不那么令人生畏, 因为你可以不断地将它们分解成越来越小的部分, 直到它们正好适合你一天中的空白。

Third, Intermediate Packets increase the quality of your work by allowing you to collect feedback more often. Instead of laboring for weeks in isolation, only to present your results to your boss or client and find out you went in the wrong direction, you craft just one small building block at a time and get outside input before moving forward. You’ll find that people give much better feedback if they’re included early, and the work is clearly in progress.  
第三, 中间包通过允许您更频繁地收集反馈来提高您的工作质量。与其孤立地工作数周, 只是为了向老板或客户展示你的结果, 然后发现你走错了方向, 你一次只制作一个小构建块, 并在继续前进之前获得外部输入。 你会发现, 如果尽早加入, 人们会提供更好的反馈, 而且这项工作显然正在进行中。

Fourth, and best of all, eventually you’ll have so many IPs at your disposal that you can execute entire projects just by assembling previously created IPs. This is a magical experience that will completely change how you view productivity. The idea of starting anything from scratch will become foreign to you—why not draw on the wealth of assets you’ve invested in in the past? People will marvel at how you’re able to deliver at such a high standard so consistently. They’ll wonder how you find the time to do so much careful thinking, when in fact you’re not working harder or longer—all you’re doing is drawing on a growing library of Intermediate Packets stored in your Second Brain. If they are truly valuable assets, then they deserve to be managed, just like any other asset you possess.  
第四, 最重要的是, 最终您将拥有如此多的 IP 供您使用, 以至于您只需组装以前创建的 IP 即可执行整个项目。这是一种神奇的体验, 将彻底改变您对生产力的看法。从头开始的想法对你来说会变得陌生——为什么不利用你过去投资的财富呢? 人们会惊叹于您如何能够始终如一地以如此高的标准交付产品。他们会想知道你是如何找到时间进行如此仔细的思考的, 而事实上你并没有更努力地工作或工作更长时间——你所做的只是利用存储在你的第二大脑中不断增长的中间数据包库。如果它们是真正有价值的资产, 那么它们就应该得到管理, 就像您拥有的任何其他资产一样。

Intermediate Packets are really a new lens through which you can perceive the atomic units that make up everything you do. By “thinking small,” you can focus on creating just one IP each time you sit down to work, without worrying about how viable it is or whether it will be used in the exact way you envisioned. This lens reframes creativity as an ongoing, continual cycle of delivering value in small bits, rather than a massive all-consuming endeavor that weighs on you for months.  
中间包实际上是一个新镜头, 通过它您可以感知构成您所做的一切的原子单元。通过 “从小处着想”, 您可以在每次坐下来工作时只专注于创建一个 IP, 而不必担心它的可行性或是否会按照您设想的方式使用它。这个镜头将创造力重新定义为一个持续的、持续的循环, 以小的方式提供价值, 而不是几个月来对你造成压力的巨大的、无所不包的努力。

### Assembling Building Blocks: The Secret to Frictionless Output  
组装积木: 无摩擦输出的秘密

Every time you make a sketch, design a slide, record a short video on your phone, or post on social media, you are undertaking a small creative act that produces a tangible by-product. Consider the different kinds of documents and other content that you probably regularly produce as part of your normal routines:  
每次绘制草图、设计幻灯片、在手机上录制短视频或在社交媒体上发帖时, 您都是在进行一个小的创意行为, 并产生有形的副产品。考虑您可能在日常工作中经常制作的不同类型的文档和其他内容:

*   Favorites or bookmarks saved from the web or social media  
    从网络或社交媒体保存的收藏夹或书签
*   Journal or diary entries with your personal reflections  
    包含您个人感想的日记或日记条目
*   Highlights or underlined passages in books or articles  
    书籍或文章中的要点或带下划线的段落
*   Messages, photos, or videos posted on social media  
    在社交媒体上发布的消息、照片或视频
*   Slides or charts included in presentations  
    演示文稿中包含的幻灯片或图表
*   Diagrams, mind maps, or other visuals on paper or in apps  
    纸上或应用程序中的图表、思维导图或其他视觉效果
*   Recordings of meetings, interviews, talks, or presentations  
    会议、访谈、谈话或演示的录音
*   Answers to common questions you receive via email  
    您通过电子邮件收到的常见问题的答案
*   Written works, such as blog posts or white papers  
    书面作品, 例如博客文章或白皮书
*   Documented plans and processes such as agendas, checklists, templates, or project retrospectives  
    记录在案的计划和流程, 例如议程、清单、模板或项目回顾

While you can sit down to purposefully create an IP, it is far more powerful to simply _notice_ the IPs that you have already produced and then to take an extra moment to save them in your Second Brain.  
虽然您可以坐下来有目的地创建一个 IP, 但更有效的方法是简单地注意您已经创建的 IP, 然后花额外的时间将它们保存在您的第二大脑中。

Let’s look at an example: planning a large conference. If it’s a brand-new event, or you’ve never organized a conference before, it might seem like you have to produce everything from scratch. However, if you break down that mega-project into concrete chunks, suddenly the components that you’ll need become clear:  
让我们看一个例子: 计划一个大型会议。如果这是一个全新的活动, 或者您以前从未组织过会议, 那么您似乎必须从头开始制作所有内容。然而, 如果你将这个大型项目分解成具体的块, 你需要的组件突然变得清晰起来:

*   A list of interesting breakout sessions  
    有趣的分组讨论列表
*   A checklist for streaming the keynote sessions  
    流媒体主题演讲的清单
*   An email announcing the conference to your network  
    向您的网络宣布会议的电子邮件
*   An invitation for people to be speakers or panelists  
    邀请人们成为演讲者或小组成员
*   A conference website 一个会议网站

These are some of the building blocks that you’ll need to be able to run the conference. You could put them all on your to-do list and make them yourself, but there’s a different, much faster, and more effective approach. Ask yourself: How could you _acquire_ or _assemble_ each of these components, instead of having to make them yourself?  
这些是您能够运行会议所需的一些构建块。你可以把它们都放在你的待办事项清单上, 然后 自己做, 但有一种不同的、更快、更有效的方法。问问自己: 您如何才能获得或组装这些组件中的每一个, 而不必自己制造它们?

The conference agenda could easily be modeled on an agenda from a different conference, with the topics and speaker names switched out. You could start compiling a list of potential breakout sessions, adding any topic suggested by others that strikes you as interesting. You might have a checklist for delivering effective keynotes left over from a live event you’ve organized in the past. Emails can draw on an archive of examples you’ve saved from other conferences you’ve attended. Screenshots of conference websites you admire are the best possible starting point for designing your own.  
会议议程可以很容易地仿照不同会议的议程, 主题和演讲者姓名互换。你可以开始编制一个潜在的分组会议列表, 添加其他人建议的你感兴趣的任何主题。您可能有一份清单, 用于提供您过去组织的现场活动留下的有效主题演讲。电子邮件可以利用您从参加过的其他会议中保存的示例存档。您欣赏的会议网站的屏幕截图是设计您自己的网站的最佳起点。

Our creativity thrives on examples. When we have a template to fill in, our ideas are channeled into useful forms instead of splattered around haphazardly. There are best practices and plentiful models for almost anything you might want to make.  
我们的创造力在例子中茁壮成长。当我们有一个模板可以填写时, 我们的想法就会转化为有用的形式, 而不是随意散布。几乎所有你想做的事情都有最佳实践和丰富的模型。

Most professionals I work with already have and use Intermediate Packets—that’s the point! Your Second Brain is the repository of things you are _already_ creating and using anyway. All we are doing is adding a little bit of structure and intentionality to how we use them: capturing them in one place, such as a digital notes app, so we can find them with a search; organizing them according to our projects, areas, and resources, so we have a dedicated place for each important aspect of our lives; and distilling them down to their most essential points, so they can be quickly accessed and retrieved.  
与我共事的大多数专业人士已经拥有并使用中间包——这就是重点! 你的第二大脑是你已经创造和使用的东西的储存库。我们所做的只是为我们如何使用它们添加一点结构和意图: 将它们捕获在一个地方, 例如数字笔记应用程序, 以便我们可以通过搜索找到它们; 根据我们的项目、领域和资源来组织它们, 这样我们就有了一个专门的地方来处理我们生活中的每个重要方面; 并将它们提炼成最重要的点, 以便可以快速访问和检索它们。

Once we’ve completed these initial steps, expression transforms from a gut-wrenching, agonizing feat to a straightforward assembly of existing packets of work.  
一旦我们完成了这些初始步骤, 表达式就会从令人痛苦、痛苦的壮举转变为现有工作包的直接组装。

Over time, your ability to quickly tap these creative assets and combine them into something new will make all the difference in your career trajectory, business growth, and even quality of life. In the short term, it might not matter. You might be able to scramble and put together a particular document right when you need it, but there will be a slowly accumulating, invisible cost. The cost of not being quite sure whether you have what you need. The stress of wondering whether you’ve already completed a task before. There is a cost to your sleep, your peace of mind, and your time with family when the full burden of constantly coming up with good ideas rests solely on your fickle biological brain.  
随着时间的推移, 您快速挖掘这些创意资产并将它们组合成新事物的能力将对您的职业轨迹、业务增长甚至生活质量产生重大影响。在 短期内, 这可能并不重要。您也许可以在需要时将特定文档打乱并放在一起, 但会慢慢积累无形的成本。不确定您是否拥有所需的东西的成本。想知道您之前是否已经完成任务的压力。当不断想出好主意的全部负担完全落在你变化无常的生物大脑上时, 你的睡眠、内心的平静以及与家人在一起的时间都会付出代价。

### How to Resurface and Reuse Your Past Work  
如何重现和重用您过去的作品

The Express step is where we practice and hone our ability to retrieve what we need, when we need it. It’s the step where we build the confidence that our Second Brain is working for us.  
快速步骤是我们练习和磨练我们在需要时检索所需内容的能力的地方。这是我们建立信心的步骤, 我们的第二大脑正在为我们工作。

Let’s take a closer look at the process of retrieval: How can you find and retrieve Intermediate Packets when you need them?  
让我们仔细看看检索过程: 如何在需要时找到并检索中间数据包?

This isn’t a trivial question, because the connection between IPs we’ve saved in the past and future projects is often quite unpredictable. A concert poster on the side of a building you snapped a photo of might inform the shapes in a logo you’re designing. A song overheard on the subway might influence a jingle you’re writing for your child’s school play. An idea about persuasion you read in a book might become a central pillar in a health campaign you are organizing for your company.  
这不是一个微不足道的问题, 因为我们过去保存的 IP 与未来项目之间的联系通常是无法预测的。您拍摄的建筑物侧面的音乐会海报可能会告知您正在设计的徽标中的形状。在地铁上无意中听到的一首歌可能会影响您为孩子的学校戏剧创作的歌曲。您在书中读到的关于说服的想法可能会成为您为公司组织的健康运动的核心支柱。

These are some of the most valuable connections—when an idea crosses the boundaries between subjects. They can’t be planned or predicted. They can emerge only when many kinds of ideas in different shapes and sizes are mixed together.  
当一个想法跨越学科之间的界限时, 这些是一些最有价值的联系。它们无法计划或预测。只有当多种不同形状和大小的想法混合在一起时, 它们才能出现。

This inherent unpredictability means that there is no single, perfectly reliable retrieval system for the ideas contained in your notes. Instead, there are four methods for retrieval that overlap and complement one another. Together they are more powerful than any computer yet more flexible than any human mind. You can step through them in order until you find what you’re looking for.  
这种固有的不可预测性意味着没有单一的、完全可靠的检索系统来检索你笔记中包含的想法。相反, 有四种检索方法相互重叠并相互补充 。它们一起比任何计算机都更强大, 但比任何人的思维都更灵活。您可以按顺序浏览它们, 直到找到您要查找的内容。

Those four retrieval methods are:  
这四种检索方法是:

#### Retrieval Method #1: Search 检索方法 #1: 搜索

The search function in your notes app is incredibly powerful. The same technology that has revolutionized how we navigate the web via search engines is also useful for navigating our private knowledge collections.  
笔记应用程序中的搜索功能非常强大。彻底改变了我们通过搜索引擎浏览 Web 的方式的技术也可用于浏览我们的私人知识库。

Search has the benefit of costing almost nothing in terms of time and effort. Just by saving your notes in a central place, you enable software to search their full contents in seconds. You can run multiple searches in quick succession, running down rabbit trails through your knowledge garden as you try out different variations of terms.  
搜索的好处是几乎不需要花费任何时间和精力。只需将您的笔记保存在一个中央位置, 您就可以让软件在几秒钟内搜索其全部内容。您可以快速连续地运行多个搜索, 在您尝试不同的术语变体时, 沿着知识花园中的兔子小径跑下去。

This quick, iterative approach to searching is where notes apps shine—you don’t have to open and close individual notes one at a time as in traditional word processing. In a sense, every note in your Second Brain is already “open,” and you can view or interact with its contents with a mere click or tap.  
这种快速、迭代的搜索方法是笔记应用程序的亮点——您不必像在传统文字处理中那样一次打开和关闭单个笔记。从某种意义上说, 第二大脑中的每个笔记都已经 “打开”, 您只需单击或点击即可查看其内容或与之互动。

Search should be the first retrieval method you turn to. It is most useful when you already know more or less what you’re looking for, when you don’t have notes saved in a preexisting folder, or when you’re looking for text, but as with every tool, it has its limitations. If you don’t know exactly what you’re looking for, don’t have a preexisting folder to look through, or are interested in images or graphics, it’s time to turn to browsing.  
搜索应该是您转向的第一个检索方法。当您已经或多或少知道要查找的内容、没有将笔记保存在预先存在的文件夹中或正在查找文本时, 它最有用, 但与所有工具一样, 它也有其局限性. 如果您不确切地知道您在寻找什么, 没有预先存在的 文件夹来浏览, 或者对图像或图形感兴趣, 是时候转向浏览了。

#### Retrieval Method #2: Browsing 检索方法 #2: 浏览

If you’ve followed the PARA system outlined in Chapter 5 to organize your notes, you already have a series of dedicated folders for each of your active projects, areas of responsibility, resources, and archives.  
如果您按照第 5 章中概述的 PARA 系统来组织您的笔记, 那么您已经为每个活动项目、职责范围、资源和档案提供了一系列专用文件夹。

Each of these folders is a dedicated environment designed specifically for focusing on that domain of your life. Each one can contain a wide range of content, from brief notes dashed off during a phone call to polished Intermediate Packets that you’ve already used in past projects. When the time comes to take action, you’ll be able to enter the appropriate workspace and know that everything found there is relevant to the task at hand.  
这些文件夹中的每一个都是专门为专注于您生活的那个领域而设计的专用环境。每一个都可以包含广泛的内容, 从电话中匆匆写下的简短笔记到您在过去的项目中已经使用过的完善的中间数据包。当需要采取行动时, 您将能够进入适当的工作区, 并知道在那里找到的所有内容都与手头的任务相关。

As powerful as search can be, studies[5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn5) have found that in many situations people strongly prefer to navigate their file systems manually, scanning for the information they’re looking for. Manual navigation gives people control over how they navigate, with folders and file names providing small contextual clues about where to look next.[6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn6) Browsing allows us to gradually home in on the information we are looking for, starting with the general and getting more and more specific. This kind of browsing uses older parts of the brain that developed to navigate physical environments, and thus comes to us more naturally.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-011)  
与搜索一样强大, 研究 [5](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn5) 发现, 在许多情况下, 人们强烈喜欢手动浏览他们的文件系统, 扫描他们正在寻找的信息。手动导航让人们可以控制他们的导航方式, 文件夹和文件名提供了关于下一步要看哪里的小上下文线索。 [6](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn6) 浏览让我们逐渐找到我们正在寻找的信息, 从一般信息开始, 然后越来越具体。这种浏览使用大脑中为导航物理环境而开发的较旧部分, 因此更自然地出现在我们身上。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-011)

There are a variety of features offered by notes apps that make it easy to browse your hierarchy of folders. Some apps allow you to “sort” a list of notes by different criteria, such as date created. This gives you an interactive timeline of your ideas from newest to oldest. Other apps allow you to show only images and web clippings, enabling rapid visual scanning to see if anything catches your eye. Most notes apps allow you to open multiple windows and compare their contents side by side so you can look for patterns and move content between them.  
笔记应用程序提供了多种功能, 可让您轻松浏览文件夹层次结构。某些应用程序允许您 根据不同的标准 (例如创建日期) 对笔记列表进行“排序”。这为您提供了从最新到最旧的想法的交互式时间表。其他应用程序允许您仅显示图像和网络剪报, 从而实现快速视觉扫描以查看是否有任何东西引起您的注意。大多数笔记应用程序允许您打开多个窗口并并排比较它们的内容, 以便您可以查找模式并在它们之间移动内容。

Once again, there are limitations to what you can find by browsing folders. Sometimes you know a project is coming and can start saving things to a project folder in advance, but sometimes you don’t. Sometimes it’s very clear which area of your business a note is related to, but often you have no idea where to put it. Many notes end up being useful in completely unexpected ways. We want to encourage that kind of serendipity, not fight it!  
再一次, 通过浏览文件夹可以找到的内容是有限制的。有时您知道一个项目即将到来, 可以提前开始将内容保存到项目文件夹中, 但有时您不知道。有时很清楚注释与您业务的哪个领域相关, 但通常您不知道将它放在哪里。许多笔记最终以完全意想不到的方式发挥作用。我们要鼓励这种偶然性, 而不是与之抗争!

It is for the unforeseen and the unexpected that tags really shine.  
标签真正闪耀的是不可预见和意想不到的事情。

#### Retrieval Method #3: Tags 检索方法 #3: 标签

Tags are like small labels you can apply to certain notes regardless of where they are located. Once they are tagged, you can perform a search and see all those notes together in one place. The main weakness of folders is that ideas can get siloed from each other, making it hard to spark interesting connections. Tags can overcome this limitation by infusing your Second Brain with connections, making it easier to see cross-disciplinary themes and patterns that defy simple categorization.  
标签就像小标签一样, 您可以将其应用于某些笔记, 而不管它们位于何处。一旦它们被标记, 您就可以执行搜索并在一个地方一起查看所有这些笔记。文件夹的主要弱点是想法可能彼此孤立, 很难激发有趣的联系。标签可以通过为您的 “第二大脑” 注入联系来克服这一限制, 从而更容易看到无法简单分类的跨学科主题和模式。

For example, maybe you work in customer service and notice that the same questions from customers keep coming up again and again. You might decide to write a Frequently Asked Questions page and add it to your company website. That is a project, but not one that you previously recognized and started gathering materials for. You might have various notes that you want to draw on to design this page, but don’t want to move them from the project, area, and resource folders where they’re currently located.  
例如, 也许您在客户服务部门工作, 并注意到客户不断提出相同的问题。您可能决定编写一个常见问题解答页面并将其添加到您的公司网站。那是一个项目, 但不是您之前认识并开始为其收集材料的项目。你可能有各种各样的笔记想要用来设计这个页面, 但是 不想将它们从它们当前所在的项目、区域和资源文件夹中移走。

It’s time for tags. You could take fifteen minutes and perform a series of searches for terms relevant to the FAQs you’ll be writing. For any useful note you find, apply a tag called “FAQ” while leaving it right where you found it. Once you’ve found enough material to work with, you can perform a single search—for the “FAQ” tag—and instantly see all the notes you’ve tagged collected in one place. Now you are free to review them more closely, highlight any specific points you want to use, and move those points into an outline to guide your writing.  
现在是标签的时候了。您可以花 15 分钟时间搜索与您将要编写的常见问题解答相关的术语。对于你找到的任何有用的笔记, 应用一个名为 “常见问题解答” 的标签, 同时将它留在你找到它的地方。找到足够的材料后, 您可以执行一次搜索——搜索 “FAQ” 标签——并立即在一个地方看到你标记的所有笔记。现在您可以自由地更仔细地查看它们, 突出显示您想要使用的任何特定要点, 并将这些要点移动到大纲中以指导您的写作。

I don’t recommend using tags as your primary organizational system. It takes far too much energy to apply tags to every single note compared to the ease of searching with keywords or browsing your folders. However, tags can come in handy in specific situations when the two previous retrieval methods aren’t up to the task, and you want to spontaneously gather, connect, and synthesize groups of notes on the fly.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-010)  
我不建议使用标签作为你的主要组织系统。与使用关键字搜索或浏览文件夹的便利性相比, 将标签应用于每个笔记需要太多的精力。但是, 在特定情况下, 当前两种检索方法不能胜任任务并且您想即时收集、连接和合成笔记组时, 标签可以派上用场。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-010)

#### Retrieval Method #4: Serendipity 检索方法 #4: 意外发现

The fourth retrieval method is the most mysterious but, in many ways, the most powerful. Beyond searching, browsing, and tagging, there is a frontier of possibility that simply cannot be planned or predicted by human minds. There are moments when it feels like the stars align and a connection between ideas jumps out at you like a bolt of lightning from a blue sky. These are the moments creatives live for.  
第四种检索方法最神秘, 但在许多方面也是最强大的。除了搜索、浏览和标记之外, 还有一个人类思维根本无法计划或预测的可能性边界。有些时刻, 感觉就像星星对齐, 想法之间的联系像蓝天划过的一道闪电一样突然向你袭来。这些是创意人赖以生存的时刻。

There is no way to plan for them, but that doesn’t mean we can’t create the ideal conditions for them to arise. This is the main reason we put all sorts of different kinds of material, on many subjects and in diverse formats, all jumbled together in our Second Brain. We are creating a soup of creative DNA to maximize the chance that new life emerges.  
没有办法为它们制定计划, 但这并不意味着我们无法为它们的出现创造理想的条件。这就是 我们将各种不同类型的材料、不同主题和不同格式的材料混杂在我们的第二大脑中的主要原因。我们正在创造创意 DNA 汤, 以最大限度地提高新生命出现的机会。

Serendipity takes a few different forms when it comes to retrieval.  
在检索方面, 意外发现有几种不同的形式。

First, while using the previous retrieval methods, it is a good idea to keep your focus a little broad. Don’t begin and end your search with only the specific folder that matches your criteria. Make sure to look through related categories, such as similar projects, relevant areas, and different kinds of resources.  
首先, 在使用前面的检索方法时, 最好将注意力放宽一些。不要仅以符合条件的特定文件夹开始和结束搜索。确保浏览相关类别, 例如类似项目、相关领域和不同种类的资源。

When starting a project, I’ll often look at five or six PARA folders just in case they contain something useful. Since you’ve carefully curated the contents of these folders, you won’t be faced with too much material in any given one. If you’re using Progressive Summarization to distill your notes, as explained in Chapter 6, you can focus only on the highlighted passages and review notes far faster than having to read every word. It usually takes me less than thirty seconds on average to review a highlighted note, which means I can set aside just ten minutes and review twenty of them or more.  
开始一个项目时, 我通常会查看五六个 PARA 文件夹, 以防它们包含有用的东西。由于您已经仔细整理了这些文件夹的内容, 因此您不会在任何给定的文件夹中遇到太多材料。如果你正在使用渐进式摘要来提炼你的笔记, 如第 6 章所述, 你可以只关注突出显示的段落和复习笔记, 这比必须阅读每个单词要快得多。我通常平均只需要不到 30 秒的时间来查看突出显示的笔记, 这意味着我可以只花 10 分钟来查看其中的 20 分钟或更多。

Second, serendipity is amplified by visual patterns. This is why I strongly suggest saving not only text notes but images as well (which is difficult to do in other kinds of software such as word processors). Our brains are naturally attuned to visuals. We intuitively absorb colors and shapes in the blink of an eye, using far less energy than it takes to read words. Some digital notes apps allow you to display only the images saved in your notes, which is a powerful way of activating the more intuitive, visual parts of your brain.  
其次, 偶然性被视觉模式放大了。这就是为什么我强烈建议不仅保存文本注释, 还要保存图像 (这在其他类型的软件(如文字处理器) 中很难做到)。我们的大脑自然地适应视觉效果。我们在眨眼间凭直觉吸收颜色和形状, 所消耗的能量远少于阅读文字所消耗的能量。一些数字笔记应用程序允许您仅显示保存在笔记中的图像, 这是激活大脑中更直观、视觉部分的有效方式。

Third, sharing our ideas with others introduces a major element of serendipity. When you present an idea to another person, their reaction is inherently unpredictable. They will often be completely uninterested in an aspect you think is utterly fascinating; they aren’t necessarily right or wrong, but you can use that feedback either way. The reverse can also happen. You might think something is obvious, while they find it mind-blowing. That is also useful feedback. Others might point out aspects of an idea you never considered, suggest looking at sources you never knew existed, or contribute their own ideas to make it better. All these forms of feedback are ways of drawing on not only your first and Second Brains, but the brains of others as well.  
第三, 与他人分享我们的想法引入了偶然性的主要因素。当你向另一个人提出一个想法时, 他们的反应本质上是不可预测的。他们通常会对您认为非常迷人的方面完全不感兴趣; 他们不是 necessary right or wrong, 但你可以用任何一种方式使用反馈。反过来也可能发生。您可能认为某些事情是显而易见的, 而他们却发现它令人兴奋。这也是有用的反馈。其他人可能会指出您从未考虑过的想法的各个方面, 建议查看您从未知道的资源, 或者贡献自己的想法以使其变得更好。所有这些形式的反馈都是利用您的第一和第二大脑, 以及其他人的大脑的方式。

### Three Stages of Expressing: What Does It Look Like to Show Our Work?  
表达的三个阶段: 展示我们的作品是什么样的?

In Chapter 3, I explained how people tend to move through three distinct stages as they grow their Second Brain and refine their knowledge management skills—remembering, connecting, and creating.  
在第 3 章中, 我解释了人们在发展第二大脑和完善知识管理技能时往往会经历三个不同的阶段——记忆、联系和创造。

Let’s look at examples of how each of these can play out using case studies from former students of mine.  
让我们通过我以前的学生的案例研究, 看看这些如何发挥作用的例子。

#### Remember: Retrieve an Idea Exactly When It’s Needed  
记住: 在需要时准确检索想法

Benigno is a father and business consultant in the Philippines, and one of his goals for building a Second Brain was to better understand the emerging cryptocurrency trend. He had tried other organizing methods before but found that the information he collected was always difficult to access. Time and again, he would “keep reading and bookmarking, then forget about it.”  
Benigno 是菲律宾的一位父亲和商业顾问, 他打造第二大脑的目标之一是更好地了解新兴的加密货币趋势。他之前也尝试过其他的组织方式, 但发现自己收集的信息总是难以获取。一次又一次, 他会 “继续阅读和收藏, 然后忘记它。”

Benigno came across an article on an innovative new kind of cryptocurrency and took a few minutes to save some excerpts from it in his notes. When a few of his friends became interested in the topic, he took eight minutes to progressively summarize the best excerpts before sharing the summarized article with them. The time that he had spent reading and understanding a complex subject paid off in time savings for his friends, while also giving them a new interest to connect over.  
Benigno 偶然发现了一篇关于创新型新型加密货币的文章, 并花了几分钟时间将其中的一些摘录保存在他的笔记中。当他的几个朋友对这个话题感兴趣时, 他用八分钟的时间逐步总结了最好的摘录, 然后与他们分享了总结的文章。他花在阅读和理解一个复杂主题上的时间为他的朋友们节省了 time, 同时也让他们产生了新的联系兴趣。

In Benigno’s words, “I instinctively knew that just sending a long article to friends usually doesn’t do anything, but because the text I am sending has been highlighted they can do a quick scan of it. Also I now have material for a future article I have been planning... all thanks to CODE.”  
用 Benigno 的话来说,“我本能地知道, 仅仅向朋友发送一篇长文章通常不会起任何作用, 但因为我发送的文本已被突出显示, 他们可以快速浏览一下。此外, 我现在为我一直在计划的未来文章准备了材料...... 这一切都要感谢 CODE。”

You don’t need to invent a new theory or write the next great novel to derive value from your Second Brain. Within days of capturing ideas that resonate with you, you’ll start to notice opportunities to share them with others to their benefit.  
你不需要发明一个新理论或写出下一部伟大的小说来从你的第二大脑中获得价值。在捕捉到与您产生共鸣的想法后的几天内, 您会开始注意到与他人分享这些想法以造福于他们的机会。

#### Connect: Use Notes to Tell a Bigger Story  
连接: 使用笔记讲述更大的故事

Patrick is a church pastor in Colorado, and he uses his Second Brain to help him design memorial services, which for him are a deeply creative experience about honoring life.  
帕特里克 (Patrick) 是科罗拉多州的一名教堂牧师, 他使用第二大脑帮助他设计追悼会, 对他来说, 这是一次关于尊重生命的极具创造性的体验。

His goal with creating a memorial service is to “tell the story of someone’s life in a way that honors and makes meaning in retrospect about how their life unfolded.” In the past, this entailed a heavy lift. But by seeing his services through the lens of his Second Brain, Patrick realized that his job was simply to gather and connect some of the themes and stories he heard in a way that was meaningful to the deceased person’s loved ones.  
他创建追悼会的目标是 “以一种尊重和有意义的方式讲述某人的生活故事, 回顾他们的生活是如何展开的。” 在过去, 这需要很重的工作。但是通过他的第二大脑的镜头来看他的服务, 帕特里克意识到他的工作只是收集和连接他听到的一些主题和故事, 以对死者的亲人有意义的方式。

Patrick used this realization to change his creative process. He began recording his conversations using an automatic transcription app on his smartphone, allowing him to be fully present with grieving families knowing he had every word captured. He saved all the transcripts from his conversations, plus obituaries, photos, and other related documents into the PARA project folder for each memorial, so he could see it all in one place. Instead of spending five to seven hours at the end of all his interviews to distill everything he had heard, he began spending fifteen minutes after each interview to highlight only the parts that resonated.  
帕特里克利用这种认识改变了他的创作过程。他开始使用智能手机上的自动转录应用程序记录他的谈话, 让他能够完全与悲伤的家人在一起, 因为他知道他已经记录下了每一个字。他将所有谈话记录以及讣告、照片和其他相关文件保存在每个纪念馆的 PARA 项目文件夹中, 这样他就可以在一个地方看到所有内容。他没有在所有采访结束时花五到七个小时来提炼他所听到的一切, 而是 开始在每次采访后花十五分钟只强调那些引起共鸣的部分。

In Patrick’s words: “Using my first brain only for what it is best at is freedom. Freedom to be present and not multitasking as I sit with grieving people hearing stories of their loved ones. Freedom to know I have everything recorded. Freedom to know that when I go to pull the memorial together, 80 percent of the work is already done.”[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-009)  
用帕特里克的话来说:“只将我的第一个大脑用于它最擅长的事情就是自由。当我和悲伤的人坐在一起听他们所爱的人的故事时, 可以自由地在场而不是一心多用。自由知道我已经记录了一切。自由地知道当我去拉纪念馆时, 80% 的工作已经完成。” [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-009)

Creative expression isn’t always about self-promotion or advancing our own career. Some of our most beautiful, creative acts are ones in which we connect the dots for others in ways they wouldn’t be able to do themselves.  
创意表达并不总是关于自我推销或推进我们自己的事业。我们的一些最美丽、最有创意的行为是我们以他人无法自行完成的方式将点点滴滴联系起来的行为。

#### Create: Complete Projects and Accomplish Goals Stress-Free  
创造: 轻松完成项目并实现目标

Rebecca is a professor of educational psychology at a university in Florida, and she uses her digital notes to create programs and presentations as part of her teaching.  
丽贝卡 (Rebecca) 是佛罗里达州一所大学的教育心理学教授, 她在教学中使用数字笔记来创建程序和演示文稿。

Before building her Second Brain, Rebecca would wait until she had a large block of time available to put together her ideas for a talk. As a busy professional and mother, those large uninterrupted blocks of time seemed scarcer than ever.  
在构建她的第二大脑之前, 丽贝卡会等到她有足够的时间来整理她的想法进行演讲。作为一个忙碌的专业人士和母亲, 那些不受干扰的大块时间似乎比以往任何时候都少。

Her digital notes gave her another way of making progress. In the weeks leading up to an event, on days she felt inspired, Rebecca began dropping short notes into her notes inbox with ideas of things she might want to include. By the time she sat down to write the outline, she realized she already had all the Intermediate Packets—metaphors, research facts, stories, diagrams—she needed at her fingertips. All she had to do was string together the notes and existing IPs she had already captured.  
她的数字笔记给了她另一种取得进步的方式。在活动开始前的几周里, 在她受到启发的那几天, 丽贝卡开始在她的笔记收件箱中放入简短的笔记, 其中包含她可能想要包含的事物的想法。当她坐下来写大纲时, 她意识到她已经拥有了她需要的所有中间包——隐喻、 research 事实、故事、图表——触手可及。她所要做的就是将她已经捕获的笔记和现有 IP 串在一起。

In Rebecca’s words: “I’m able to look at my priorities—my priorities for my work, my priorities for my family, my marriage, etc.—and then only focus in the moment on those projects that are on my plate now.”  
用 Rebecca 的话来说:“我能够审视我的优先事项——我工作的优先事项、我的家庭、我的婚姻的优先事项, 等等——然后只在当下关注那些在我盘子里的项目。”

Whatever you are responsible for creating—whether it is documents or presentations or decisions or outcomes—your Second Brain is a vital repository of all the bits and pieces you’ll want in front of you when you sit down to focus. It is a creative environment you can step into at any time, in any place, when it’s time to make things happen.  
无论您负责创建什么——无论是文档、演示文稿、决策还是结果——您的第二大脑都是一个重要的存储库, 存储着您在坐下来集中注意力时需要呈现在您面前的所有点点滴滴。这是一个创造性的环境, 您可以在任何时间、任何地点进入, 让事情发生。

### Creativity Is Inherently Collaborative  
创造力本质上是协作的

A common myth of creativity is that of the solitary artist, working in total isolation. We are implicitly told that we must shut ourselves off from the influence of others and flesh out our masterpiece by the sweat of our brow.  
一个常见的创造力神话是孤独的艺术家, 在完全孤立的情况下工作。我们被含蓄地告知, 我们必须将自己与他人的影响隔离开来, 并通过我们额头的汗水来充实我们的杰作。

In my experience, this isn’t how creativity works at all. It doesn’t matter what medium you work in; sooner or later you must work with others. If you’re a musician, you’ll need a sound engineer to mix the record. If you’re an actor, you’ll need a director who believes in you. Even writing a book, which may suggest images of a lonely cabin deep in the woods, is an intensively social exercise. A book is created out of a dance between an author and their editor.  
根据我的经验, 这根本不是创造力的运作方式。你使用什么媒介工作并不重要; 迟早你必须与他人合作。如果您是音乐家, 则需要一名音响工程师来混音唱片。如果你是演员, 你需要一个相信你的导演。即使是写一本书, 可能会让人联想到树林深处一个孤独的小屋的画面, 也是一种密集的社交活动。一本书是由作者和他们的编辑之间的舞蹈创作出来的。

Reframing your work in terms of Intermediate Packets isn’t just about doing the same old stuff in smaller chunks. That doesn’t unlock your true potential. The transformation comes from the fact that smaller chunks are inherently more shareable and collaborative.  
根据中间数据包重新构建您的工作不仅仅是在较小的块中做同样的旧事情。那并不能释放你真正的潜力。这种转变源于这样一个事实, 即较小的块本质上更易于共享和协作。

It is much easier to show someone a small thing, and ask for their thoughts on it, rather than the entire opus you’re creating. It’s less confronting to hear criticism on one small aspect of your work, at an early stage when you still have time to correct it, than getting a negative reaction after months of effort. You can use each little piece of intermediate feedback to refine what you’re making—to make it more focused, more appealing, more succinct, or easier to understand.  
向某人展示一件小事并征求他们的想法要容易得多, 而不是你正在创作的整个作品。在你还有时间纠正它的早期阶段, 听到对你工作的一个小方面的批评, 比经过几个月的努力得到负面反应要少面对。您可以使用每一小段中间反馈来改进您正在制作的东西——使其更专注、更吸引人、更简洁或更容易理解。

The fundamental difficulty of creative work is that we are often too close to it to see it objectively. Getting feedback is really about borrowing someone else’s eyes to see what only a novice can see. It’s about stepping outside your subjective point of view and noticing what’s missing from what you’ve made.  
创造性工作的根本困难在于我们常常离它太近而无法客观地看待它。获得反馈实际上是借用别人的眼睛, 看看只有新手才能看到的东西。这是关于跳出你的主观观点并注意你所做的东西中缺少的东西。

Once you understand how incredibly valuable feedback is, you start to crave as much of it as you can find. You start looking for every opportunity to share your outputs and gain some clarity on how other people are likely to receive it. These moments are so important that you will begin changing how you work in order to get feedback as early and often as possible, because you know it is much easier to gather and synthesize the thoughts of others than to come up with an endless series of brilliant thoughts on your own. You will begin to see yourself as the curator of the collective thinking of your network, rather than the sole originator of ideas.  
一旦您了解反馈的宝贵价值, 您就会开始渴望获得尽可能多的反馈。你开始寻找每一个机会来分享你的成果, 并清楚地了解其他人可能会如何接受它。这些时刻是如此重要, 以至于你将开始改变你的工作方式, 以便尽早并尽可能多地获得反馈, 因为你知道收集和综合他人的想法比想出一系列无休止的辉煌要容易得多自己的想法。您将开始将自己视为网络集体思维的策展人, 而不是思想的唯一发起者。

There are certain notes in your Second Brain that are disproportionately valuable, that you will find yourself returning to again and again. These are the cornerstones of your work on which everything else is built, but you can’t usually know which notes are cornerstones up front. You discover them by sharing your ideas with others, and seeing which ones resonate with them. It is by sharing our ideas with other people that we discover which ones represent our most valuable expertise.  
在你的 “第二大脑” 中有一些特别有价值的笔记, 你会发现自己一次又一次地回来阅读。这些是你工作的基石, 其他一切都建立在这些基础上, 但你通常无法预先知道哪些笔记是基石。您可以通过与他人分享您的想法并查看哪些想法与他们产生共鸣来发现它们。通过与其他人分享我们的想法, 我们发现哪些想法代表了我们最有价值的专业知识。

### Everything Is a Remix 一切都是混音

The CODE Method is based on an important aspect of creativity: that it is always a remix of existing parts. We all stand on the shoulders of our predecessors. No one creates anything out of a pure void.  
CODE 方法基于创造力的一个重要方面: 它始终是现有部分的重新组合。我们都站在前人的肩膀上。没有人能从纯粹的空虚中创造出任何东西。

Kitbashing is a practice used in making small-scale models for action movies like _Star Wars_ and _Indiana Jones_. To stay within time and budget, model makers buy prefabricated commercial kits and recombine them into new models for their sets. Instead of fabricating new pieces from scratch, these premade parts—from models of World War II flak cannons, US Navy battleships, fighter planes, T-34 tanks, and submarines—can be used to add texture and fine detail to special effects scenes in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost it would normally take.  
Kitbashing 是一种用于为星球大战和夺宝奇兵等动作片制作小型模型的做法。为了不超出时间和预算, 模型制作者购买预制的商业套件并将它们重新组合成新的模型。这些预制部件 (来自二战高射炮、美国海军战列舰、战斗机、T-34 坦克和潜艇的模型) 无需从头开始制造新部件, 可用于为特效场景添加纹理和精细细节时间和成本的一小部分。

Adam Savage, host of the popular _MythBusters_ television show and a skilled model maker, noted that because these pieces are so versatile, “There were some kits to which you would return repeatedly.” As part of the team at Industrial Light & Magic, the studio behind many special effects films, he relied on a particular kit that found its way into almost every model the team ever built.[7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn7)  
Adam Savage 是广受欢迎的 MythBusters 电视节目的主持人, 也是一位技术娴熟的模型制作者, 他指出, 由于这些作品用途广泛,“有些套件你会反复使用。” 作为许多特效电影背后的工作室 Industrial Light & Magic 团队的一员, 他依赖于一种特殊的套件, 该套件几乎融入了该团队建造的每一个模型。 [7](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch07fn7)

Don’t take the work of others wholesale; borrow _aspects_ or _parts_ of their work. The shape of a banner on a web page, the layout of a slide, the style of a song—these are like the ingredients you put in a blender before hitting the button and mixing it into your own recipe. Of course, cite all your sources and influences, even if you don’t strictly have to. Giving credit where credit is due doesn’t lessen the value of your contribution—it increases it. Having a Second Brain where all your sources are clearly documented will make it much easier to track them down and include those citations in the finished version.  
不要批发别人的工作; 借用他们工作的某些方面或部分。网页上横幅的形状、幻灯片的布局、歌曲的风格——这些就像你在按下按钮之前放入搅拌机并将其混合到你自己的食谱中的成分。当然, 即使不是必须, 也要引用所有来源和影响。在信用到期时给予信用不会降低您贡献的价值——它会增加它。拥有一个清晰记录所有来源的 “第二大脑” 将使追踪它们并将这些引用包含在最终版本中变得容易得多。

I remember the first time someone referred to what I do as “your work.” It dawned on me that I had a body of work that stood on its own, that had an identity distinct from mine. This is a turning point in the life of any creative professional—when you begin to think of “your work” as something separate from yourself.  
我记得第一次有人称我所做的为 “你的工作”。我突然意识到我有一个独立的作品集, 具有与我截然不同的身份。这是任何创意专业人士生活的转折点——当您开始将“您的工作” 视为与您自己分离的东西时。

Reframing your productivity in terms of Intermediate Packets is a major step toward this turning point. Instead of thinking of your job in terms of _tasks_, which always require you to be there, personally, doing everything yourself, you will start to think in terms of _assets_ and _building blocks_ that you can assemble.  
根据中间数据包重新构建您的生产力是迈向这一转折点的重要一步。与其从任务的角度来思考你的工作, 这总是需要你亲自在那里, 亲自做所有事情, 你将开始从你可以组装的资产和构建块的角度来思考。

As the potential of your intellectual assets becomes apparent, you’ll start to look for any way to spend your time creating such assets and avoid one-off tasks whenever possible. You will start to seek out ways of acquiring or outsourcing the creation of these assets to others, instead of assuming you have to build them all yourself. These changes will enable you to get things done at a pace that is far beyond what mere “productivity tips” can ever achieve.  
随着您的智力资产的潜力变得明显, 您将开始寻找任何方法来花费时间来创造此类资产并尽可能避免一次性任务。你将开始寻找获取或外包这些资产的方法给他人, 而不是假设你必须自己构建它们。这些变化将使您能够以远远超出单纯的 “生产力技巧” 所能达到的速度完成工作。

Even if you’re not writing a book now, or creating a presentation now, or developing a new framework now, that doesn’t mean you never will. Every little digital artifact you create—the emails, the meeting notes, the project plans, the templates, the examples—is part of the ongoing evolution of your body of work. They are like the neurons in an intelligent organism that is growing, evolving, reaching for higher levels of consciousness with each new experience it has.  
即使您现在不写书、不创建演示文稿或开发新框架, 也不意味着您永远不会。您创建的每个小数字工件——电子邮件、会议记录、项目计划、模板、示例——都是您工作主体不断发展的一部分。它们就像一个智能生物体中的神经元, 随着它拥有的每一次新体验, 它正在成长、进化、达到更高的意识水平。

### Your Turn: You Only Know What You Make  
轮到你了: 你只知道你做了什么

My favorite quote about creativity is from the eighteenth-century philosopher Giambattista Vico: _Verum ipsum factum_. Translated to English, it means “We only know what we make.”  
我最喜欢的关于创造力的名言来自 18 世纪的哲学家 Giambattista Vico:Verum ipsum factum。翻译成英文, 意思是 “我们只知道我们做了什么。”

To truly “know” something, it’s not enough to read about it in a book. Ideas are merely thoughts until you put them into action. Thoughts are fleeting, quickly fading as time passes. To truly make an idea stick, you have to engage with it. You have to get your hands dirty and apply that knowledge to a practical problem. We learn by making concrete things—before we feel ready, before we have it completely figured out, and before we know where it’s going.  
要真正 “了解” 某事, 仅在书中阅读是不够的。在将想法付诸行动之前, 想法只是想法。思绪转瞬即逝, 随着时间的流逝迅速消退。要真正让一个想法坚持下去, 你必须参与其中。您必须亲自动手并将这些知识应用到实际问题中。我们通过做具体的事情来学习——在我们觉得准备好之前, 在我们完全弄清楚之前, 在我们知道它的发展方向之前。

It is when you begin expressing your ideas and turning your knowledge into action that life really begins to change. You’ll read differently, becoming more focused on the parts most relevant to the argument you’re building. You’ll ask sharper questions, no longer satisfied with vague explanations or leaps in logic. You’ll naturally seek venues to show your work, since the feedback you receive will propel your thinking forward like nothing else. You’ll begin to act more deliberately in your career or business, thinking several steps beyond what you’re consuming to consider its ultimate potential.  
当你开始表达你的想法并将你的知识转化为行动时, 生活才真正开始改变。你会以不同的方式阅读, 更加关注与你正在构建的论点最相关的部分。你会提出更尖锐的问题, 不再满足于模糊的解释或逻辑上的飞跃。您自然会寻找展示您作品的场所, 因为您收到的反馈会像其他任何东西一样推动您的思考。你将开始在你的职业或业务中更加谨慎地行事, 思考超出你所消耗的几个步骤来考虑它的最终潜力。

It’s not necessarily about becoming a professional artist, online influencer, or business mogul: it’s about taking ownership of your work, your ideas, and your potential to contribute in whatever arena you find yourself in. It doesn’t matter how impressive or grand your output is, or how many people see it. It could be just between your family or friends, among your colleagues and team, with your neighbors or schoolmates—what matters is that you are finding your voice and insisting that what you have to say matters. You have to value your ideas enough to share them. You have to believe that the smallest idea has the potential to change people’s lives. If you don’t believe that now, start with the smallest project you can think of to begin to prove to yourself that your ideas can make a difference.  
这不一定是要成为专业艺术家、网络影响者或商业大亨: 这是关于掌握您的作品、您的想法以及您在任何领域做出贡献的潜力。输出是, 或者有多少人看到它。它可能只是在你的家人或朋友之间, 在你的同事和团队之间, 在你的邻居或同学之间——重要的是你正在寻找你的声音并坚持你必须说的话很重要。你必须足够重视你的想法才能分享它们。你必须相信最小的想法有可能改变人们的生活。如果您现在不相信, 请从您能想到的最小项目开始, 开始向自己证明您的想法可以产生影响。

You might realize you have lots of notes on eating healthy and decide to experiment with your own take on a classic recipe. You might see the notes from courses you’ve taken to improve your project management skills and decide to put them together into a presentation for your coworkers. You could draw on the insights and life experiences you’ve written about in your notes to write a blog post or record a YouTube video to help people who are facing a similar challenge.  
您可能会意识到自己有很多关于健康饮食的注意事项, 并决定自己尝试采用经典食谱。你 可能会看到你为提高项目管理技能而参加的课程的笔记, 并决定将它们放在一起展示给你的同事。您可以利用您在笔记中写下的见解和生活经历来撰写博客文章或录制 YouTube 视频, 以帮助面临类似挑战的人们。

All of these are acts of self-expression enabling you to begin unlocking your full creative potential.  
所有这些都是自我表达的行为, 使您能够开始释放您的全部创造潜力。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-012-backlink). Intermediate Packets are abbreviated as IPs, a lucky coincidence that is appropriate, because they are absolutely your Intellectual Property. You created them, you own them, and you have the right to use them again and again in any future project.  
    我 。 Intermediate Packets 缩写为 IPs, 恰如其分的幸运巧合, 因为它们绝对是你的知识产权。您创建了它们, 拥有它们, 并且您有权在未来的任何项目中一次又一次地使用它们。
2.  [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-011-backlink). Barbara Tversky, a professor of psychology and education at Teachers College in New York, notes that “We are far better and more experienced at spatial thinking than at abstract thinking. Abstract thought can be difficult in and of itself, but fortunately it can often be mapped onto spatial thought in one way or another. That way, spatial thinking can substitute for and scaffold abstract thought.”  
    二。纽约师范学院心理学和教育学教授芭芭拉 · 特沃斯基 (Barbara Tversky) 指出,“我们在空间思维方面比在抽象思维方面做得更好, 也更有经验。抽象思维本身可能很困难, 但幸运的是, 它通常可以以一种或另一种方式映射到空间思维上。这样, 空间思维就可以替代抽象思维并为其提供支撑。”

4.  [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-009-backlink). One of my favorite rules of thumb is to “Only start projects that are already 80 percent done.” That might seem like a paradox, but committing to finish projects only when I’ve already done most of the work to capture, organize, and distill the relevant material means I never run the risk of starting something I can’t finish.  
    四、我最喜欢的经验法则之一是 “只开始已经完成 80% 的项目”。这似乎是一个悖论, 但只有当我已经完成了大部分工作来捕捉、组织和提炼相关材料时才承诺完成项目, 这意味着我永远不会冒着开始无法完成的事情的风险。

I was fortunate to grow up in a multicultural household full of art and music.  
我很幸运在一个充满艺术和音乐的多元文化家庭中长大。

My mother is a singer and guitarist from Brazil, and some of my earliest memories are of her soprano voice singing beautiful Portuguese lyrics to the tune of a classical guitar. My father is a professional painter born in the Philippines. His canvases bursting with colorful fruits, verdant landscapes, and monumental figures covered every wall of our house, giving our home the ambience of an art gallery.  
我的母亲是来自巴西的歌手和吉他手, 我最早的一些记忆是她的女高音用古典吉他的曲调演唱优美的葡萄牙歌词。我的父亲是一位出生在菲律宾的职业画家。他的画布上布满了五颜六色的水果、翠绿的风景和不朽的人物, 覆盖了我们房子的每一面墙, 给我们的家带来了艺术画廊的氛围。

I’ve never recognized the common stereotypes of the “tortured artist”—mercurial, unpredictable, brooding, and unreliable. My father is one of the most orderly, responsible people I’ve ever met. Yet this regularity didn’t take away from his fantastically creative artwork—it contributed to it. I saw how rigorous his routines had to be to allow him to pursue his creative calling while raising a family.  
我从来没有意识到 “受折磨的艺术家” 的常见刻板印象——善变、不可预测、沉思和不可靠。我父亲是我见过的最有条理、最负责任的人之一。然而, 这种规律性并没有影响他极具创意的作品——反而助长了它。我看到他的日常生活必须多么严格才能让他在养家糊口的同时追求他的创造性使命。

He had a series of what he called his “strategies.” These were habits and tricks that he used to integrate creativity into every aspect of his life and quickly get into a creative state of mind whenever he had time to paint.  
他有一系列他称之为 “策略” 的东西。正是这些习惯和技巧, 让他把创造力融入到生活的方方面面, 一有空就画画, 迅速进入创作状态。

During sermons at our local church, my father would practice sketching biblical stories in a small paper notebook as he listened. Those sketches would often become the starting point for larger, full-scale works measuring eight or ten feet high. While browsing the supermarket he would buy vegetables with unusual shapes to take home and incorporate into his still lifes. Our groceries doubled as models before we ate them. Often in the evening when we were watching TV together as a family, I’d catch him looking off to the side, at the wall of our living room, where he had hung a painting he was working on. He said he could have insights about what was missing by looking at it in a new light and out of the corner of his eye.  
在我们当地教堂布道期间, 我父亲会边听边练习在一个小纸质笔记本上画出圣经故事。这些草图通常会成为八英尺或十英尺高的大型全尺寸作品的起点。在逛超市时, 他会买一些形状奇特的蔬菜带回家, 融入他的静物画中。在我们吃之前, 我们的食品杂货已成为模型。经常在晚上, 当我们全家一起看电视时, 我会发现他向旁边看, 在我们客厅的墙上, 他挂着一幅他正在画的画。他说, 他可以通过用眼角的余光从新的角度观察它, 从而了解缺失的东西。

My father planned for creativity. He strategized his creativity. When it was time to make progress on a painting, he gave it his full focus, but that wasn’t the only time he exercised his imagination. Much of the rest of the time he was collecting, sifting through, reflecting on, and recombining raw material from his daily life so that when it came time to create, he had more than enough raw material to work with. This attention to organizing his creative influences fueled a prolific body of work made up of thousands of paintings created over decades, while still allowing him plenty of time to attend our soccer games, cook delicious meals, and travel widely as a family.  
我父亲计划创造力。他为自己的创造力制定了策略。当需要在一幅画上取得进展时, 他会全神贯注, 但这并不是他唯一一次发挥想象力的时候。其余大部分时间, 他都在收集、筛选、反思和重新组合日常生活中的原材料, 以便在创作时, 他有足够多的原材料可以使用。这种对组织他的创造性影响的关注推动了由数十年来创作的数千幅画组成的多产作品, 同时仍然让他有充足的时间参加我们的足球比赛, 做可口的饭菜, 并作为一个家庭广泛旅行。

What I learned from my father is that by the time you sit down to make progress on something, all the work to gather and organize the source material needs to already be done. We can’t expect ourselves to instantly come up with brilliant ideas on demand. I learned that innovation and problem-solving depend on a routine that systematically brings interesting ideas to the surface of our awareness.[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-008)  
我从父亲那里学到的是, 当你坐下来在某件事上取得进展时, 所有收集和组织原始资料的工作都需要已经完成。我们不能指望自己能根据需要立即想出绝妙的主意。我了解到, 创新和解决问题取决于一种例行公事, 这种例行公事系统地将有趣的想法带到我们的意识表面。 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-008)

All the steps of the CODE Method are designed to do one thing: to help you put your digital tools to work for you so that your human, fallible, endlessly creative first brain can do what it does best. Imagine. Invent. Innovate. Create.  
CODE 方法的所有步骤都旨在做一件事: 帮助您使用数字工具为您工作, 以便您的人性、易犯错误、永无止境的第一大脑可以做它最擅长的事情。想象。发明。创新。创造。

Building a Second Brain is really about _standardizing_ the way we work, because we only really improve when we standardize the way we do something. To get stronger, you need to lift weights using the correct form. A musician relies on standardized notes and time signatures so they don’t have to reinvent the basics from scratch every time. To improve your writing, you need to follow the conventions of spelling and grammar (even if you decide to break those rules for special effect down the road).  
打造第二大脑实际上是关于标准化我们的工作方式, 因为只有标准化我们做事的方式, 我们才能真正进步。要变得更强壮, 您需要使用正确的形式举重。音乐家依赖标准化的音符和拍号, 因此他们不必每次都从头开始重新发明基础知识。为了改进你的写作, 你需要遵循拼写和语法的惯例 (即使你决定打破这些规则以获得特殊效果)。

Through the simple acts of capturing ideas, organizing them into groups, distilling the best parts, and assembling them together to create value for others, we are practicing the basic moves of knowledge work in such a way that we can improve on them over time.  
通过捕捉想法、将它们组织成组、提炼出最好的部分并将它们组合在一起为他人创造价值的简单行为, 我们正在以这样一种方式实践知识工作的基本动作, 即我们可以随着时间的推移改进它们。

This standardized routine is known as the _creative process_, and it operates according to timeless principles that can be found throughout history. By identifying the principles that stand the test of time despite huge changes in the underlying technology, we can better understand the essential nature of creativity.  
这种标准化的程序被称为创作过程, 它根据贯穿整个历史的永恒原则运作。尽管基础技术发生了巨大变化, 但通过确定经得起时间考验的原则, 我们可以更好地理解创造力的本质。

The _products_ of creativity are constantly changing and there is always a new “hot” trend to run after. One year it’s Instagram photos, the next it’s Snapchat stories, the next it’s TikTok videos, and so on forever. Even the long tradition of the novel has evolved for each era.  
创意的产品不断变化, 总有新的 “热门” 趋势可以追赶。一年是 Instagram 照片, 下一年是 Snapchat 故事, 下一年是 TikTok 视频, 等等。甚至小说的悠久传统也随着时代的发展而演变。

But if you go one level deeper, to the _process_ of creativity, it is a very different story. The creative process is ancient and unchanging. It was the same thousands of years ago as it is today. There are lessons we can learn on that deeper level that transcend any particular medium and any particular set of tools.  
但如果你更深入一点, 创造力的过程, 那就是一个非常不同的故事。创作过程是古老而不变的。几千年前和今天一样。我们可以在超越任何特定媒介和任何特定工具集的更深层次上吸取教训。

One of the most important patterns that underlies the creative process is called “divergence and convergence.”[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-007)  
构成创作过程基础的最重要模式之一称为 “发散和收敛”。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-007)

### Divergence and Convergence: A Creative Balancing Act  
发散与融合: 创造性的平衡法

If you look at the process of creating anything, it follows the same simple pattern, alternating back and forth between divergence and convergence.  
如果你看一下创造任何东西的过程, 它遵循相同的简单模式, 在发散和收敛之间来回交替。

A creative endeavor begins with an act of divergence. You open the space of possibilities and consider as many options as possible. Like Taylor Swift’s notes, Twyla Tharp’s box, Francis Ford Coppola’s prompt book, or Octavia Butler’s commonplace notebooks, you begin to gather different kinds of outside inspiration, expose yourself to new influences, explore new paths, and talk to others about what you’re thinking. The number of things you are looking at and considering is increasing—you are diverging from your starting point.  
创造性的努力始于发散行为。您打开可能性的空间并考虑尽可能多的选择。就像 Taylor Swift 的笔记、Twyla Tharp 的盒子、Francis Ford Coppola 的提示书或 Octavia Butler 的普通笔记本一样, 你开始收集各种外部灵感, 让自己接触新的影响, 探索新的道路, 并与他人谈论你在做什么思维。您正在查看和考虑的事物的数量在增加——您正在偏离您的起点。

The activity of divergence is familiar to all of us: it is the classic whiteboard covered in sketches, the writer’s wastepaper basket filled with crumpled-up drafts, and the photographer with hundreds of photos laid out across the floor. The purpose of divergence is to generate new ideas, so the process is necessarily spontaneous, chaotic, and messy. You can’t fully plan or organize what you’re doing in divergence mode, and you shouldn’t try. This is the time to wander.  
分歧的活动对我们所有人来说都很熟悉: 它是覆盖着草图的经典白板, 作家的废纸篓里装满了皱巴巴的草稿, 摄影师的数百张 照片散落在地板上。发散的目的是为了产生新的想法, 所以这个过程必然是自发的、混乱的、凌乱的。你不能完全计划或组织你在发散模式下所做的事情, 你不应该尝试。这是流浪的时间。

As powerful and necessary as divergence is, if all we ever do is diverge, then we never arrive anywhere. Like Francis Ford Coppola highlighting certain passages and crossing out others in _The Godfather_ novel, at some point you must start discarding possibilities and converging toward a solution. Otherwise, you will never get the rewarding sense of completion that comes with hitting “send” or “publish” and stepping back from the canvas or screen knowing you got the job done.  
与分歧一样强大和必要, 如果我们所做的一切都是分歧, 那么我们永远不会到达任何地方。就像弗朗西斯 · 福特 · 科波拉 (Francis Ford Coppola) 在《教父》小说中强调某些段落并划掉其他段落一样, 在某些时候, 您必须开始放弃各种可能性并集中精力寻找解决方案。否则, 您将永远不会获得完成工作时点击 “发送” 或“发布”并从画布或屏幕上退下来时所带来的成就感。

Convergence forces us to eliminate options, make trade-offs, and decide what is truly essential. It is about narrowing the range of possibilities so that you can make forward progress and end up with a final result you are proud of. Convergence allows our work to take on a life of its own and become something separate from ourselves.  
趋同迫使我们消除选择、权衡取舍并决定什么是真正必要的。它是关于缩小可能性的范围, 以便您可以取得进步并最终获得您引以为豪的最终结果。融合使我们的工作拥有自己的生命, 并成为与我们自己分离的东西。

The model of divergence and convergence is so fundamental to all creative work, we can see it present in any creative field.  
发散和收敛的模型对于所有创造性工作来说都是如此基础, 我们可以在任何创造性领域看到它。

Writers diverge by collecting raw material for the story they want to tell, sketching out potential characters, and researching historical facts. They converge by making outlines, laying out plot points, and writing a first draft.  
作家们通过为他们想要讲述的故事收集原材料、勾勒出潜在人物以及研究历史事实来发散。他们通过制定大纲、布置情节点和撰写初稿来汇合。

Engineers diverge by researching all the possible solutions, testing the boundaries of the problem, or tinkering with new tools. They converge by deciding on a particular approach, designing the implementation details, and bringing their blueprints to life.  
工程师通过研究所有可能的解决方案、测试问题的边界或修补新工具来发散。他们通过决定一种特定的方法、设计实施细节并将他们的蓝图变为现实来融合。

Designers diverge by collecting samples and patterns, talking to users to understand their needs, or sketching possible solutions. They converge by deciding on a problem to solve, building wireframes, or translating their designs into graphics files.  
设计师通过收集样本和模式、与用户交谈以了解他们的需求或草拟可能的解决方案来发散分歧。他们通过决定要解决的问题、构建线框或将他们的设计转化为图形文件来汇聚。

Photographers diverge by taking photos of things they find interesting, juxtaposing different kinds of photos together, or experimenting with new lighting or framing techniques. They converge by choosing the shots for a collection, archiving unused images, and printing their favorites.  
摄影师通过拍摄他们感兴趣的事物的照片、将不同类型的照片并置在一起, 或者尝试新的照明或取景技术来发散。他们通过为收藏选择镜头、归档未使用的图像以及打印他们的最爱来汇聚。

If we overlay the four steps of CODE onto the model of divergence and convergence, we arrive at a powerful template for the creative process in our time.  
如果我们将 CODE 的四个步骤叠加到发散和收敛模型上, 我们就会为我们这个时代的创作过程找到一个强大的模板。

The first two steps of CODE, Capture and Organize, make up divergence. They are about gathering seeds of imagination carried on the wind and storing them in a secure place. This is where you research, explore, and add ideas. The final two steps, Distill and Express, are about convergence. They help us shut the door to new ideas and begin constructing something new out of the knowledge building blocks we’ve assembled.  
CODE 的前两个步骤, Capture 和 Organize, 弥补了分歧。它们是关于收集随风飘扬的想象力的种子, 并将它们存放在安全的地方。这是您研究、探索和添加想法的地方。最后两个步骤 Distill 和 Express 是关于收敛的。它们帮助我们关上新想法的大门, 并开始从我们组装的知识构建块中构建新的东西。

### The Three Strategies I Use to Bring Creative Work Together  
我用来整合创意作品的三种策略

Your Second Brain is a powerful ally in overcoming the universal challenge of creative work—sitting down to make progress and having no idea where to start.  
你的第二大脑是克服创造性工作普遍挑战的强大盟友——坐下来取得进步, 却不知道从哪里开始。

Should you do more research, or start organizing the research you’ve already done?  
你应该做更多的研究, 还是开始组织你已经完成的研究?

Should you widen your horizons, or narrow your focus?  
你应该扩大你的视野, 还是缩小你的注意力?

Should you start something new, or finish something you’ve already started?  
你应该开始新的事情, 还是完成你已经开始的事情?

When you distinguish between the two modes of divergence and convergence, you can decide each time you begin to work which mode you want to be in, which gives you the answers to the questions above. In divergence mode, you want to open up your horizons and explore every possible option. Open the windows and doors, click every link, jump from one source to another, and let your curiosity be your guide for what to do next. If you decide to enter convergence mode, do the opposite: close the door, put on noise-canceling headphones, ignore every new input, and ferociously chase the sweet reward of completion. Trust that you have enough ideas and enough sources, and it’s time to turn inward and sprint toward your goal.  
当你区分发散和收敛这两种模式时, 你可以在每次开始工作时决定你想要处于哪种模式, 这会给你上面问题的答案。在发散模式下, 您想开阔视野并探索每一个可能的选择。打开窗户和门, 点击每个链接, 从一个来源跳到另一个来源, 让您的好奇心引导您下一步做什么。如果你决定进入收敛模式, 反其道而行之: 关上门, 戴上降噪耳机, 忽略每一个新的输入, 并疯狂地追逐完成后的甜蜜奖励。相信你有足够的想法和足够的资源, 是时候转向内心并朝着你的目标冲刺了。

Of the two stages of this process, convergence is where most people struggle.  
在这个过程的两个阶段中, 融合是大多数人挣扎的地方。

The more imaginative and curious you are, the more diverse your interests, and the higher your standards and commitment to perfection, the more difficult you will likely find it to switch from divergence mode into convergence mode. It’s painful to cut off options and choose one path over another. There is a kind of creative grief in watching an idea that you know is full of potential get axed from a script or a story. This is what makes creative work challenging.  
你越有想象力和好奇心, 你的兴趣越多样化, 你的标准和追求完美的承诺越高, 你就越难从发散模式切换到收敛模式。切断选项并选择一条道路而不是另一条道路是痛苦的。看着一个你知道充满潜力的想法从剧本或故事中被砍掉, 这是一种创造性的悲伤。这就是使创造性工作具有挑战性的原因。

When you sit down to finish something—whether it’s an explanatory email, a new product design, a research report, or a fundraising strategy—it can be so tempting to do more research. It’s so easy to open up dozens of browser tabs, order more books, or go off in completely new directions. Those actions are tempting because they _feel_ like productivity. They feel like forward progress, when in fact they are divergent acts that postpone the moment of completion.  
当你坐下来完成某件事时——无论是一封解释性电子邮件、一项新产品设计、一份研究报告, 还是一项筹款策略——你很想做更多的研究。打开几十个浏览器选项卡、订购更多书籍或朝着全新的方向前进是如此容易。这些行为很诱人, 因为它们 感觉像生产力。它们感觉像是在向前推进, 而实际上它们是推迟完成时间的不同行为。

There are three powerful strategies for completing creative projects I recommend to help you through the pitfalls of convergence. Each of them depends on having a Second Brain where you can manipulate and shape information without worrying it will disappear. Think of them as the tools in your Second Brain tool belt, which you can turn to anytime you need to get unstuck, find your way around obstacles, or decide what to do next.  
我推荐三种用于完成创意项目的强大策略, 以帮助您克服趋同的陷阱。他们每个人都依赖于拥有第二大脑, 在那里你可以操纵和塑造信息而不用担心它会消失。将它们视为您的 “第二大脑” 工具带中的工具, 您可以在需要摆脱困境、绕过障碍或决定下一步做什么时随时使用它们。

#### 1. The Archipelago of Ideas: Give Yourself Stepping-Stones  
1. 思想群岛: 给自己垫脚石

The Archipelago of Ideas technique is valuable any time you are starting a new piece of work—whether it’s a how-to guide, a training workshop, a brief for a new project, or an essay you’re publishing on your blog. It gives you a way to plan your progress even when performing tasks that are inherently unpredictable. The technique is named after a quote by Steven Johnson, the author of a series of fascinating books on creativity, innovation, and the history of ideas.[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch08fn1) As Johnson wrote:  
每当你开始一项新工作时, 无论是操作指南、培训研讨会、新项目简介, 还是你要在博客上发表的文章, 创意群岛技术都很有价值。它为您提供了一种计划进度的方法, 即使在执行本质上不可预测的任务时也是如此。该技术以 Steven Johnson 的一句话命名, 他是一系列关于创造力、创新和思想史的引人入胜的书籍的作者。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch08fn1) 正如约翰逊所写:

> _Instead of confronting a terrifying blank page, I’m looking at a document filled with quotes: from letters, from primary sources, from scholarly papers, sometimes even my own notes. It’s a great technique for warding off the siren song of procrastination. Before I hit on this approach, I used to lose weeks stalling before each new chapter, because it was just a big empty sea of nothingness. Now each chapter starts life as a kind of archipelago of inspiring quotes, which makes it seem far less daunting. All I have to do is build bridges between the islands.  
> 我没有面对一张可怕的空白页, 而是看着一份充满引语的文件: 来自信件、第一手资料、学术论文, 有时甚至是我自己的笔记。这是避免拖延的好方法。在我想到这个方法之前, 我常常在每个新章节之前浪费数周的时间来拖延, 因为那只是一片空无一物的大海。现在每一章都以鼓舞人心的名言群岛开始生活, 这让它看起来不那么令人生畏。我所要做的就是在岛屿之间架起桥梁。_

An archipelago is a chain of islands in the ocean, usually formed by volcanic activity over long spans of time. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, are an archipelago of eight major islands extending over about 1,500 miles of the Pacific Ocean.  
群岛是海洋中的一连串岛屿, 通常由长时间的火山活动形成。例如, 夏威夷群岛是由八个主要岛屿组成的群岛, 延伸超过太平洋约 1,500 英里。

To create an Archipelago of _Ideas_, you divergently gather a group of ideas, sources, or points that will form the backbone of your essay, presentation, or deliverable. Once you have a critical mass of ideas to work with, you switch decisively into convergence mode and link them together in an order that makes sense.  
要创建想法群岛, 您需要分散地收集一组想法、来源或要点, 它们将构成您的论文、演示文稿或可交付成果的主干。一旦你有了足够多的想法可以使用, 你就会果断地切换到融合模式, 并以有意义的顺序将它们联系在一起。

Here’s an example of an Archipelago of Ideas note I created to help me write an in-depth article on commonplace books:  
这是我为帮助我写一篇关于平凡书籍的深入文章而创建的思想群岛笔记的示例:

The underlined links (which appear in green in my notes) are the sources I’m drawing on as research. Clicking a link will lead me not to the public web, where I can easily get distracted, but to another note _within_ my Second Brain containing my full notes on that source.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-006) There I will find all the details I might need, as well as a link back to the original work for my citations.  
带下划线的链接 (在我的笔记中以绿色显示) 是我作为研究所借鉴的来源。单击一个链接不会将我带到公共网络, 在那里我很容易分心, 而是将我带到我的第二大脑中的另一个笔记, 其中包含我对该来源的完整笔记。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-006) 在那里我会找到我可能需要的所有详细信息, 以及指向我引用的原始作品的链接。

Below each source, I’ve copied and pasted only the points I specifically want to use in this particular piece of writing. This Archipelago of Ideas includes external sources as in my example above, but also notes I’ve taken based on my own thoughts and experiences. This gives me the best of both worlds: I can focus only on the relevant points right in front of me, but all the other details I might need are just a click away. The bolds and highlights of Progressive Summarization help me quickly determine which parts are most interesting and important at a glance.  
在每个来源下方, 我只复制并粘贴了我特别想在这篇特定文章中使用的要点。这个想法群岛包括我上面示例中的外部资源, 但也包括我根据自己的想法和经验所做的笔记。这让我两全其美: 我可以只关注眼前的相关点, 但我可能需要的所有其他细节只需单击一下即可。 Progressive Summarization 的粗体和高亮部分帮助我快速确定哪些部分是最有趣和最重要的, 一目了然。

The Archipelago of Ideas technique is a contemporary reinvention of the age-old practice of outlining—laying out the points you want to include up front, so that when it comes time to execute all you have to do is string them together. The note you see above is exactly what I will want in front of me when I sit down in convergence mode to finish the first draft of my article.  
思想群岛技术是对古老的大纲做法的当代改造——预先列出你想要包括的要点, 这样当需要执行时, 你所要做的就是将它们串在一起。当我以收敛模式坐下来完成我的文章初稿时, 你在上面看到的注释正是我想要的。

Creating outlines digitally instead of on paper offers multiple major advantages:  
以数字方式而不是在纸上创建轮廓具有多个主要优势:

*   **A digital outline is far more malleable and flexible**—you can add bullet points and cross them off, rearrange and expand on them, add bolding and highlights, and edit them after the fact as your thinking changes.  
    数字大纲更具延展性和灵活性——您可以添加项目符号点并将它们划掉, 重新排列和扩展它们, 添加粗体和突出显示, 并在事后根据您的想法变化进行编辑。
*   **The outline can link to more detailed content**—instead of trying to cram every last point onto the same page, you can link to both your own private notes and public resources on the web, which helps avoid overloading the outline with too much detail.  
    大纲可以链接到更详细的内容——你可以链接到你自己的私人笔记和网络上的公共资源, 而不是试图将最后一点塞进同一页, 这有助于避免大纲超载细节。
*   **The outline is interactive and multimedia**—you can add not only text, but images, GIFs, videos, attachments, diagrams, checkboxes, and more.  
    大纲是交互式和多媒体的——您不仅可以添加文本, 还可以添加图像、GIF、视频、附件、图表、复选框等。
*   **The outline is searchable**—even if it gets long, you have a powerful search feature to instantly call up any term you’re looking for.  
    大纲是可搜索的——即使它很长, 您也可以使用强大的搜索功能立即调出您要查找的任何术语。
*   **The outline can be accessed and edited from anywhere**—unlike a piece of paper in a notebook, your outline is instantaneously synced to every one of your devices, and it can be viewed, edited, and added to from anywhere.  
    可以从任何地方访问和编辑大纲——与笔记本中的一张纸不同, 您的大纲会立即同步到您的每台设备, 并且可以从任何地方查看、编辑和添加。

An Archipelago of Ideas separates the two activities your brain has the most difficulty performing at the same time: _choosing_ ideas (known as selection) and _arranging_ them into a logical flow (known as sequencing).  
想法群岛将大脑最难同时执行的两项活动分开: 选择想法 (称为选择) 并将它们安排成逻辑流程(称为排序)。

The reason it is so difficult to perform these activities simultaneously is they require different modes: selection is divergent, requiring an open state of mind that is willing to consider any possibility. Sequencing is convergent, requiring a more closed state of mind focused only on the material you already have in front of you.  
同时执行这些活动如此困难的原因是它们需要不同的模式: 选择是发散的, 需要愿意考虑任何可能性的开放心态。排序是收敛的, 需要更封闭的心态, 只关注你面前已有的材料。

The goal of an archipelago is that instead of sitting down to a blank page or screen and stressing out about where to begin, you start with a series of small stepping-stones to guide your efforts. First you select the points and ideas you want to include in your outline, and then in a separate step, you rearrange and sequence them into an order that flows logically. This makes both of those steps far more efficient, less taxing, and less vulnerable to interruption.  
群岛的目标是, 您不必坐在空白页或屏幕上并强调从哪里开始, 您可以从一系列小垫脚石开始, 以指导您的努力。首先, 您选择要包含在大纲中的要点和想法, 然后在一个单独的步骤中, 将它们重新排列并按逻辑顺序排列。这使得这两个步骤都更加高效, 负担更少, 并且更不容易受到干扰。

Instead of starting with scarcity, start with abundance—the abundance of interesting insights you’ve collected in your Second Brain.  
与其从稀缺开始, 不如从丰富开始——你在第二大脑中收集到的丰富有趣的见解。

#### 2. The Hemingway Bridge: Use Yesterday’s Momentum Today  
2. 海明威大桥: 今天使用昨天的动力

Ernest Hemingway was one of the most recognized and influential novelists of the twentieth century. He wrote in an economical, understated style that profoundly influenced a generation of writers and led to his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1954.  
欧内斯特 · 海明威是二十世纪最受认可和影响最大的小说家之一。他以简洁、低调的风格写作, 深刻影响了一代作家, 并使他获得了 1954 年的诺贝尔文学奖。

Besides his prolific works, Hemingway was known for a particular writing strategy, which I call the “Hemingway Bridge.” He would always end a writing session only when he knew what came next in the story. Instead of exhausting every last idea and bit of energy, he would stop when the next plot point became clear. This meant that the next time he sat down to work on his story, he knew exactly where to start. He built himself a bridge to the next day, using today’s energy and momentum to fuel tomorrow’s writing.[IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-005)  
除了他多产的作品, 海明威还以一种特殊的写作策略而闻名, 我称之为 “海明威桥”。只有当他知道故事接下来会发生什么时, 他才会结束写作环节。他不会穷尽所有的想法和精力, 而是在下一个情节点变得清晰时停下来。这意味着下次他坐下来写他的故事时, 他确切地知道从哪里开始。他为自己架起了通向明天的桥梁, 用今天的能量和动力为明天的写作加油。 [IV](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-005)

You can think of a Hemingway Bridge as a bridge between the islands in your Archipelago of Ideas. You may have the islands, but that is just the first step. The much more challenging work is linking them together into something that makes sense, whether it is a piece of writing, the design of an event, or a business pitch. The Hemingway Bridge is a way of making each creative leap from one island to the next less dramatic and risky: you keep some energy and imagination in reserve and use it as a launchpad for the next step in your progress.  
您可以将海明威大桥想象成您的思想群岛中岛屿之间的桥梁。你可能拥有这些岛屿, 但这只是第一步。更具挑战性的工作是将它们联系在一起, 形成有意义的东西, 无论是一篇文章、一个活动的设计, 还是一个商业宣传。海明威大桥是一种让从一个岛屿到另一个岛屿的每一次创造性飞跃都不那么戏剧化和冒险的方式: 你保留一些能量和想象力, 并将其用作下一步进步的发射台。

How do you create a Hemingway Bridge? Instead of burning through every last ounce of energy at the end of a work session, reserve the last few minutes to write down some of the following kinds of things in your digital notes:  
你是如何建造一座海明威桥的? 与其在工作会议结束时消耗掉最后一盎司的能量, 不如保留最后几分钟在数字笔记中写下以下一些内容:

*   **Write down ideas for next steps:** At the end of a work session, write down what you think the next steps could be for the next one.  
    写下下一步的想法: 在工作会议结束时, 写下您认为下一个步骤可能是什么。
*   **Write down the current status:** This could include your current biggest challenge, most important open question, or future roadblocks you expect.  
    写下当前状态: 这可能包括您当前最大的挑战、最重要的未解决问题或您预期的未来障碍。
*   **Write down any details you have in mind that are likely to be forgotten once you step away:** Such as details about the characters in your story, the pitfalls of the event you’re planning, or the subtle considerations of the product you’re designing.  
    写下您想到的任何一旦您离开后可能会忘记的细节: 例如关于您故事中人物的细节、您计划的事件的陷阱或您正在设计的产品的微妙考虑.
*   **Write out your intention for the next work session:** Set an intention for what you plan on tackling next, the problem you intend to solve, or a certain milestone you want to reach.  
    写下你下一次工作的意图: 为你接下来要解决的问题、你打算解决的问题或你想要达到的某个里程碑设定一个意图。

The next time you resume this endeavor, whether that’s the next day or months later, you’ll have a rich set of jumping-off points and next steps waiting for you. I often find that my subconscious mind keeps working in the background to help me improve on those thoughts. When I return to the project, I can combine the results of my past thinking with the power of a good night’s sleep and put them together into a creative breakthrough.  
下次你恢复这项工作时, 无论是第二天还是几个月后, 你都会有一组丰富的起点和后续步骤等着你。我经常发现我的潜意识一直在幕后工作, 以帮助我改进这些想法。当我回到项目中时, 我可以将我过去思考的结果与良好睡眠的力量结合起来, 并将它们组合成一个创造性的突破。

To take this strategy a step further, there is one more thing you can do as you wrap up the day’s work: send off your draft or beta or proposal for feedback. Share this Intermediate Packet with a friend, family member, colleague, or collaborator; tell them that it’s still a work-in-process and ask them to send you their thoughts on it. The next time you sit down to work on it again, you’ll have their input and suggestions to add to the mix of material you’re working with.  
为使这一策略更进一步, 在结束一天的工作时, 您还可以做一件事: 发送您的草稿或测试版或提案以征求反馈。与朋友、家人、同事或合作者分享此中间包; 告诉他们这仍然是一个半成品, 并请他们向您发送他们对此的想法。 下次您坐下来再次处理它时, 您将获得他们的意见和建议, 以添加到您正在处理的材料组合中。

#### 3. Dial Down the Scope: Ship Something Small and Concrete  
3. 缩小范围: 运送一些小而具体的东西

A third technique I recommend for convergence I call “Dial Down the Scope.”  
我推荐的第三种融合技术我称之为 “缩小范围”。

“Scope” is a term from project management that has been adopted by software developers, from whom I learned it while working in Silicon Valley. The scope refers to the full set of features a software program might include.  
“范围” 是项目管理中的一个术语, 已被软件开发人员采用, 我是在硅谷工作时从他们那里学到的。范围是指软件程序可能包含的全套功能。

Let’s say you’re designing a fitness app. You sketch out a beautiful vision: it will have workout tracking, calorie counts, a gym finder, progress charts, and even connect you with others via a social network. It’s going to be amazing! It will transform people’s lives!  
假设您正在设计一款健身应用程序。你勾勒出一个美好的愿景: 它将有锻炼跟踪、卡路里计数、健身房查找器、进度表, 甚至可以通过社交网络将你与其他人联系起来。这将是惊人的! 它将改变人们的生活!

As with so many ambitious goals, once you get into the details it dawns on you just how complex these features are to build. You have to design the user interface, but also build the backend system to make it work. You have to hire customer support representatives and train them how to troubleshoot problems. You need a whole finance operation to keep track of payments and comply with regulations. Not to mention all the responsibilities of managing employees, dealing with investors, and developing a long-term strategy.  
与许多雄心勃勃的目标一样, 一旦您了解了细节, 您就会明白构建这些功能有多么复杂。您必须设计用户界面, 还必须构建后端系统以使其正常工作。您必须聘请客户支持代表并培训他们如何解决问题。您需要一个完整的财务操作来跟踪付款并遵守法规。更不用说管理员工、与投资者打交道和制定长期战略的所有职责了。

The solution that software teams landed on to deal with this kind of ballooning complexity is to “dial down the scope.” Instead of postponing the release of the app, which might prove disastrous in the face of looming competition and only delays the learning they need, the development team starts “dialing down” features as the release date approaches. The social network gets postponed to a future version. The progress charts lose their interactive features. The gym finder gets canceled completely. The first parts to be dialed down are the ones that are most difficult or expensive to build, that have the most uncertainty or risk, or that aren’t central to the purpose of the app. Like a hot-air balloon trying to take off, more and more features get thrown overboard to lighten the load and get the product off the ground. Any features that don’t make it into this version can always be released as part of future software updates.  
软件团队为应对这种不断膨胀的复杂性而采用的解决方案是 “缩小范围”。开发团队没有推迟应用程序的发布, 这在迫在眉睫的竞争面前可能是灾难性的, 只会延迟他们需要的学习, 而是随着发布日期的临近开始“减少” 功能。社交网络被推迟到未来的版本。进度图表失去了交互功能。健身房查找器被完全取消。首先要降低的部分是 最难构建或最昂贵的部分, 具有最大不确定性或风险的部分, 或者不是应用程序目的的核心部分。就像试图起飞的热气球一样, 越来越多的功能被扔到船外以减轻负载并使产品离开地面。任何未包含在此版本中的功能都可以作为未来软件更新的一部分发布。

How does this relate to our careers as knowledge workers?  
这与我们作为知识工作者的职业有何关系?

We also deliver complex pieces of work under strict deadlines. We also have limited time, money, attention, and support—there are always constraints we must work within.  
我们还在严格的期限内交付复杂的工作。我们的时间、金钱、注意力和支持也是有限的——我们必须在一定范围内工作。

When the full complexity of a project starts to reveal itself, most people choose to delay it. This is true of projects at work, and even more true of side projects we take on in our spare time. We tell ourselves we just need more time, but the delay ends up creating more problems than it solves. We start to lose motivation as the time horizon stretches out longer and longer. Things get lost or go out of date. Collaborators move on, technology becomes obsolete and needs to be upgraded, and random life events never fail to interfere. Postponing our goals and desires to “later” often ends up depriving us of the very experiences we need to grow.  
当一个项目的全部复杂性开始显露出来时, 大多数人会选择推迟它。工作中的项目如此, 我们在业余时间从事的业余项目更是如此。我们告诉自己我们只需要更多时间, 但拖延最终造成的问题多于解决的问题。随着时间范围越来越长, 我们开始失去动力。东西丢失或过时了。合作者继续前进, 技术变得过时并需要升级, 随机的生活事件永远不会干扰。将我们的目标和愿望推迟到 “以后” 通常最终会剥夺我们成长所需的经验。

The problem isn’t a lack of time. It is that we forget that we have control over the _scope_ of the project. We can “dial it down” to a more manageable size, and we must if we ever want to see it finished.  
问题不在于缺乏时间。是我们忘记了我们可以控制项目的范围。我们可以将它 “调低” 到更易于管理的大小, 如果我们想看到它完成, 我们就必须这样做。

Waiting until you have everything ready before getting started is like sitting in your car and waiting to leave your driveway until all the traffic lights across town are green at the same time. You can’t wait until everything is perfect. There will always be something missing, or something else you think you need. Dialing Down the Scope recognizes that not all the parts of a given project are equally important. By dropping or reducing or postponing the least important parts, we can unblock ourselves and move forward even when time is scarce.  
等到一切准备就绪后再开始, 就像坐在车里等着整个城市的所有交通灯同时变绿才离开车道。你不能等到一切都完美。总会缺少某些东西, 或者您认为需要的其他东西。缩小范围认识到并非给定项目的所有部分都同样重要。通过放弃、减少或推迟最不重要的部分, 即使时间紧迫, 我们也可以畅通无阻并继续前进。

Your Second Brain is a crucial part of this strategy, because you need a place to save the parts that get postponed or removed.  
Your Second Brain 是这个策略的关键部分, 因为你需要一个地方来保存被推迟或删除的部分。

You might cut sentences or entire pages from an article you’re writing, or delete scenes from a video you’re making, or drop parts of a speech when you’re trying to keep within your allotted time. This is a completely normal and necessary part of any creative process.  
您可能会从您正在撰写的文章中删除句子或整个页面, 或者从您正在制作的视频中删除场景, 或者在您试图保持在分配的时间内时删除部分演讲。这是任何创作过程中完全正常且必要的部分。

That doesn’t mean you have to throw away those parts. One of the best uses for a Second Brain is to collect and save the scraps on the cutting-room floor in case they can be used elsewhere. A slide cut from a presentation could become a social media post. An observation cut from a report could become the basis for a conference presentation. An agenda item cut from a meeting could become the starting point for the next meeting. You never know when the rejected scraps from one project might become the perfect missing piece in another. The possibilities are endless.  
这并不意味着您必须扔掉这些部件。第二大脑的最佳用途之一是收集和保存裁剪室地板上的废料, 以备在其他地方使用。从演示文稿中剪下的幻灯片可能会成为社交媒体帖子。从报告中截取的观察可以成为会议报告的基础。从会议中删除的议程项目可能成为下一次会议的起点。你永远不知道什么时候一个项目中被拒绝的废料可能会成为另一个项目中完美缺失的部分。可能性是无止境。

Knowing that nothing I write or create truly gets lost—only saved for later use—gives me the confidence to aggressively cut my creative works down to size without fearing that I’ve wasted effort or that I’ll lose the results of my thinking forever. Knowing that I can always release a fix, update, or follow up on anything I’ve made in the past gives me the courage to share my ideas before they’re perfectly ready and before I have them all figured out. And sharing before I feel ready has completely altered the trajectory of my career.  
知道我写或创造的任何东西都不会真正丢失——只是保存以备后用——让我有信心积极地削减我的创意作品的大小, 而不用担心我的努力是白费的, 或者我会永远失去我思考的结果. 知道我总是可以发布修复、更新或跟进我过去所做的任何事情, 这让我有勇气在它们完全准备好之前和我把它们全部弄清楚之前分享我的想法。在我准备好之前分享已经完全改变了我的职业轨迹。

Whatever you are building, there is a smaller, simpler version of it that would deliver much of the value in a fraction of the time. Here are some examples:  
无论您在构建什么, 都有一个更小、更简单的版本, 可以在很短的时间内提供大部分价值。这里有些例子:

*   If you want to write a book, you could dial down the scope and write a series of online articles outlining your main ideas. If you don’t have time for that, you could dial it down even further and start with a social media post explaining the essence of your message.  
    如果你想写一本书, 你可以缩小范围, 写一系列概述你的主要思想的在线文章。如果你没有时间这样做, 你可以进一步降低它并从社交媒体帖子开始解释你的信息的本质。
*   If you want to deliver a workshop for paying clients, you could dial it down to a free workshop at a local meetup, or dial it down even further and start with a group exercise or book club for a handful of colleagues or friends.  
    如果你想为付费客户举办一个研讨会, 你可以在当地聚会上将其调低到一个免费的研讨会, 或者进一步调低它并从为少数同事或朋友进行的小组练习或读书俱乐部开始.
*   If you’d like to make a short film, start with a YouTube video, or if that’s too intimidating, a livestream. If it’s still too much, record a rough cut on your phone and send it to a friend.  
    如果你想制作一部短片, 可以从 YouTube 视频开始, 或者如果这太吓人的话, 可以从直播开始。如果仍然太多, 请在手机上录制粗剪并发送给朋友。
*   If you want to design a brand identity for a company, start with a mock-up of a single web page. Even easier, start with a few hand-drawn sketches with your ideas for a logo.  
    如果您想为公司设计品牌标识, 请从单个网页的模型开始。更简单的是, 从一些手绘草图和您对徽标的想法开始。

How can you know which direction to take your thinking without feedback from customers, colleagues, collaborators, or friends? And how can you collect that feedback without showing them something concrete? This is the chicken-and-egg problem of creativity: you don’t know what you should create, but you can’t discover what people want until you create something. Dialing Down the Scope is a way of short-circuiting that paradox and testing the waters with something small and concrete, while still protecting the fragile and tentative edges of your work.  
如果没有来自客户、同事、合作者或朋友的反馈, 您怎么能知道将您的想法转向哪个方向? 您如何在不向他们展示具体内容的情况下收集反馈? 这就是创造力的先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题: 你不知道自己应该创造什么, 但只有创造出一些东西, 你才能发现人们想要什么。缩小范围是一种让悖论短路并用小而具体的东西测试水域的方法, 同时仍然保护你工作的脆弱和试探性的边缘。

Divergence and convergence are not a linear path, but a loop: once you complete one round of convergence, you can take what you’ve learned right back into a new cycle of divergence. Keep alternating back and forth, making iterations each time until it’s something you can consider “done” or “complete” and share more widely.  
发散和收敛不是一条直线路径, 而是一个循环: 一旦你完成一轮收敛, 你就可以把你学到的东西带回到新的发散循环中。保持来回交替, 每次都进行迭代, 直到你认为它 “完成” 或“完成”并更广泛地分享。

### Divergence and Convergence in the Wild: Behind the Scenes of a Home Project  
野外的分歧与融合: 家庭项目的幕后

Let me share an example of one of my own projects in which I used all three of these techniques: remodeling our garage into a home office.  
让我分享一个我自己的项目的例子, 我在其中使用了所有这三种技术: 将我们的车库改造成家庭办公室。

When we moved into our home, my wife and I soon realized we needed a better workspace. We both work from home, and the tiny extra bedroom wasn’t cutting it, especially once our son was born. We excitedly made plans to turn our garage into a home studio. The moment I created a dedicated project folder, I knew it was on.  
当我们搬进我们的家时, 我和我的妻子很快意识到我们需要一个更好的工作空间。我们都在家工作, 额外的小卧室并没有减少它, 尤其是在我们的儿子出生后。我们兴奋地制定了将我们的车库变成家庭工作室的计划。在我创建专用项目文件夹的那一刻, 我就知道它已经打开了。

I started by creating an Archipelago of Ideas—an outline of the main questions, considerations, desired features, and constraints I thought our project would entail. Here is the outline I came up with after fifteen minutes:  
我首先创建了一个想法群岛——我认为我们的项目将涉及的主要问题、考虑因素、所需特性和限制的概述。这是我在十五分钟后得出的大纲:

I didn’t know up front what the main headings of this document would include, but as I wrote out my thoughts they soon emerged: Intro, Cost, Ideas, Phases, Aesthetics, Zoom Setup, Equipment, and Open Questions. I did a few searches of my Second Brain for terms like “home office” and “home studio” and found several existing notes that could come in handy as well. For example, I found the notes with recommendations from a friend who had experience designing studios, which I mentioned previously; photos of a beautifully designed café in Mexico City that my wife and I loved visiting and wanted to mimic; and a note with best practices for hosting Zoom calls, such as finding the right lighting and a background that isn’t too distracting. I added links to them at the bottom of my outline as well.  
我事先不知道这份文件的主要标题会包括什么, 但当我写下我的想法时, 它们很快就出现了: 介绍、成本、想法、阶段、美学、缩放设置、设备和未决问题。我在我的第二大脑中搜索了一些术语, 如 “家庭办公室” 和“家庭工作室”, 并发现了一些现有的笔记也可以派上用场。例如, 我找到了一个有设计工作室经验的朋友推荐的笔记, 这是我之前提到的; 墨西哥城一家设计精美的咖啡馆的照片, 我和我的妻子很喜欢光顾并想模仿; 以及有关主持 Zoom 通话的最佳实践的说明, 例如找到合适的照明和不会太分散注意力的背景。我还在大纲底部添加了指向它们的链接。

Even with some existing material to work with, there were gaps in our plan. Over the next few weeks, whenever I had a free window of time, I collected and captured tidbits of content to inform our home studio remodel. I saved photos from Pinterest showing examples of home offices that I thought looked neat; notes from a conversation with a musician friend who taught me about soundproofing; and a list of local contractors a neighbor shared with me to reach out to. I even went on a late-night spree watching dozens of videos of YouTubers giving tours of their studios, taking notes on the small details of how they converted empty spaces into functional workspaces.  
即使有一些现有的材料可以使用, 我们的计划也存在差距。在接下来的几周里, 每当我有空闲时间时, 我都会收集并捕捉内容花絮, 为我们的家庭工作室改造提供信息。我保存了 Pinterest 上的照片, 展示了我认为看起来整洁的家庭办公室的例子; 与教我隔音的音乐家朋友的谈话笔记; 以及邻居与我分享的当地承包商名单。我什至在深夜狂欢观看了 YouTube 用户参观工作室的数十个视频, 记录了他们如何将空置空间转变为功能性工作空间的细节。

Between managing the business and our household, my time was incredibly scarce as we began the remodel. Whenever I could, I would highlight and distill the last few notes I’d captured and leave my future self a brief note about where I left off. I used a series of Hemingway Bridges to string together many such windows of time that otherwise wouldn’t have been of much productive use.  
在管理企业和我们的家庭之间, 当我们开始改造时, 我的时间非常少。只要有可能, 我就会突出显示并提炼出我记录的最后几个笔记, 并给未来的自己留下简短的笔记, 说明我在哪里停下来。我使用了一系列海明威桥将许多这样的时间窗口串在一起, 否则这些时间窗口不会有太多的生产用途。

Finally, as all these thoughts and ideas and wishes and dreams began to add up, the project became quite a juggernaut. Before I knew it, our ambitions had expanded to knocking down walls, cutting through the roof for a skylight, laying down cable for superfast Internet, and redesigning the layout of the backyard to accommodate it all. We had diverged too far and needed to rein it in a bit.  
最后, 随着所有这些想法、想法、愿望和梦想开始叠加, 这个项目变得非常强大。在我不知不觉中, 我们的野心已经扩大到推倒墙壁、切开屋顶开天窗、铺设超高速互联网的电缆, 以及重新设计后院的布局以容纳这一切。我们分歧太大, 需要稍微控制一下。

This is where Dialing Down the Scope was essential: we identified the most outlandish of our plans and decided to save those for a later stage. I moved those ideas to their own “someday/maybe” section of my outline to revisit later. My wife and I also added several constraints to the project, such as the budget we were willing to spend, and a deadline to have the remodel done by a certain date. These constraints helped us reduce the scope of the project to something reasonable and manageable. As soon as we did, the next steps of finding a contractor and finalizing the floorplan became crystal clear.  
这就是缩小范围的关键所在: 我们确定了我们计划中最古怪的一个, 并决定将它们留到以后再做。我将这些想法移到了大纲中它们自己的 “某天 / 也许” 部分, 以便稍后重新访问。我和我的妻子还为该项目添加了一些限制条件, 例如我们愿意花费的预算, 以及在特定日期之前完成改造的最后期限。这些约束帮助我们将项目范围缩小到合理且可管理的范围内。一旦我们这样做了, 寻找承包商和最终确定平面图的下一步就变得非常清楚了。

### Your Turn: Move Fast and Make Things  
轮到你了: 快速行动并创造事物

If you’d like to give this approach to executing projects a try, now is the perfect time.  
如果您想尝试使用这种方法来执行项目, 现在是最佳时机。

Start by picking one project you want to move forward on. It could be one you identified in Chapter 5, when I asked you to make folders for each active project. It could alternatively be something you know you want to (or have to) get started on. The more uncertain, new, or challenging the project, the better.  
从选择一个你想继续推进的项目开始。它可能是您在第 5 章中确定的, 当时我要求您为每个活动项目创建文件夹。它也可以是你知道你想要 (或必须) 开始的事情。项目越不确定、越新或越具有挑战性, 就越好。

Make an outline with your goals, intentions, questions, and considerations for the project. Start by writing out anything already on your mind, and then peruse your PARA categories for related notes and Intermediate Packets. These could include points or takeaways from previously created notes, inspiration from models or examples you want to borrow from, or templates you can use to follow best practices.  
列出项目的目标、意图、问题和注意事项。首先写下您心中已有的任何内容, 然后仔细阅读您的 PARA 类别以查找相关的注释和中间包。这些可能包括以前创建的笔记中的要点或要点、模型或示例的灵感 你想借用, 或者你可以用来遵循最佳实践的模板。

Here are some useful questions to ask as you conduct your search:  
以下是您进行搜索时要问的一些有用问题:

*   Is there a book or article you could extract some excerpts from as inspiration?  
    有没有一本书或文章可以摘录一些作为灵感?
*   Are there websites that might have resources you could build upon?  
    是否有可能拥有您可以构建的资源的网站?
*   Are there podcasts by experts you could subscribe to and listen to while commuting or doing household chores?  
    是否有您可以在通勤或做家务时订阅和收听的专家播客?
*   Are there relevant IPs buried in other projects you’ve worked on in the past?  
    您过去从事的其他项目中是否埋藏着相关的 IP?

Some material you find will be very succinct and highly polished, while some might be quite rough. It doesn’t matter—your only goal is to get all the potentially usable material in one place. Move all the notes and IPs you might want to use into a new project folder.  
您发现的一些材料会非常简洁和高度抛光, 而有些材料可能非常粗糙。没关系——您唯一的目标是将所有可能可用的材料放在一个地方。将您可能想要使用的所有注释和 IP 移动到一个新的项目文件夹中。

Set a timer for a fixed period of time, such as fifteen or twenty minutes, and in one sitting see if you can complete a first pass on your project _using only the notes you’ve gathered in front of you_. No searching online, no browsing social media, and no opening multiple browser tabs that you swear you’re going to get to eventually. Only work with what you already have. This first pass could be a plan, an agenda, a proposal, a diagram, or some other format that turns your ideas into a tangible artifact.  
设置一个固定时间段的计时器, 例如十五或二十分钟, 然后坐下来看看您是否可以仅使用您面前收集的笔记来完成项目的第一遍。无需在线搜索, 无需浏览社交媒体, 也无需打开您发誓最终会打开的多个浏览器选项卡。只使用你已经拥有的东西。第一步可以是计划、议程、提案、图表或其他一些可以将您的想法变成有形工件的格式。

You might experience some FOMO—that inner Fear of Missing Out—that pushes you to seek out yet another morsel of information somewhere out there. You will probably be tempted to go off and “do more research,” but you are not _completing_ the entire project in one sitting. You are only creating the first iteration—a draft of your essay, a sketch of your app, a plan for your campaign. Ask yourself, “What is the smallest version of this I can produce to get useful feedback from others?”  
您可能会经历一些 FOMO(害怕错过), 这会促使您去外面的某个地方寻找另一条信息。你可能会想要离开并 “做更多的研究”, 但你并不能一口气完成整个项目。您只是在创建第一个迭代——您的论文草稿、 您的应用程序草图、您的活动计划。问问自己,“为了从他人那里获得有用的反馈, 我可以制作的最小版本是什么?”

If you find that you can’t complete the first iteration in one sitting, start by building a Hemingway Bridge to the next time you can work on it. List open questions, remaining to-dos, new avenues to explore, or people to consult. Share what you’ve produced with someone who can give you feedback while you’re away and save their comments in a new note in the same project folder. You can collect this feedback in a private conversation with a trusted colleague, or publicly on social media at full blast, or anywhere in between. Pick a venue for sharing that you feel comfortable with.  
如果您发现您无法一次完成第一次迭代, 请从建造一座海明威桥开始, 以便下次您可以继续工作。列出悬而未决的问题、待办事项、要探索的新途径或要咨询的人。与可以在您离开时为您提供反馈的人分享您制作的内容, 并将他们的评论保存在同一项目文件夹中的新笔记中。您可以通过与可信赖的同事的私下对话收集这些反馈, 也可以在社交媒体上公开收集这些反馈, 或者介于两者之间的任何地方。选择一个您觉得舒服的分享场所。

If you feel resistance to continuing with this project later, try Dialing Down the Scope. Drop the least important features, postpone the hardest decisions for later, or find someone to help you with the parts you’re least familiar with.  
如果您以后觉得不想继续这个项目, 请尝试缩小范围。放弃最不重要的功能, 推迟最艰难的决定, 或者找人帮助你处理你最不熟悉的部分。

Throughout every step of this process, be sure to keep notes on anything you learn or discover, or any new Intermediate Packets you might want to seek out. Once your biological brain is primed by this first pass through your notes, you’ll start to notice signs and clues related to it everywhere you look. Save those clues as notes as well! Once you’re finished with your first iteration, have gathered feedback, and collected a new set of notes to work with, you’ll be ready for whatever comes next.  
在这个过程的每一步中, 一定要记下你学到或发现的任何东西, 或者你可能想要寻找的任何新的中间包。一旦你的生物大脑为第一次浏览你的笔记做好准备, 你就会开始注意到与它相关的标志和线索。将这些线索也保存为笔记! 一旦您完成了第一次迭代、收集了反馈并收集了一组新的工作笔记, 您就可以为接下来的一切做好准备。

Your Second Brain is a practical system for enhancing your productivity _and_ your creativity.  
Your Second Brain 是一个实用的系统, 可以提高您的工作效率和创造力。

While these domains are often seen as mutually exclusive opposites—one concrete and defined; the other abstract and open-ended—instead I see them as complementary. When we are organized and efficient, that creates space for creativity to arise. When we have confidence in our creative process, we don’t have to think about it as much, significantly reducing the background stress of constantly worrying whether we’re going in the right direction.  
虽然这些领域通常被视为相互排斥的对立面——一个具体而明确; 另一个是抽象的和开放式的——相反, 我认为它们是互补的。当我们井井有条且高效时, 就会为创造力的产生创造空间。当我们对自己的创作过程充满信心时, 我们就不必考虑太多, 从而大大减少了不断担心我们是否朝着正确的方向前进的背景压力。

This balance between order and creativity is something that we can build into our Second Brain intentionally. Like every system, a Second Brain needs regular maintenance. There is a certain level of organization that you want to maintain in your digital world, so that when you go there to get things done, your virtual workspaces support your productivity instead of interfering with it.  
这种秩序和创造力之间的平衡是我们可以有意构建到我们的第二大脑中的东西。像每个系统一样, a 第二大脑需要定期维护。您希望在您的数字世界中保持一定程度的组织, 这样当您去那里完成工作时, 您的虚拟工作空间可以支持您的工作效率而不是干扰它。

“Being organized” isn’t a personality trait you’re born with, nor is it merely a matter of finding the right apps or tools. Being organized is a habit—a repeated set of actions you take as you encounter, work with, and put information to use. If we’re constantly scrambling to find our notes, drafts, brainstorms, and sources, not only do we waste precious time, but we also sabotage our momentum. At each step of CODE, there are habits that can help us be more organized so that our creativity has space to arise.  
“有条理” 不是你与生俱来的人格特质, 也不仅仅是找到合适的应用程序或工具的问题。有条理是一种习惯——当你遇到、处理和使用信息时, 你会重复采取一系列行动。如果我们不断地争先恐后地寻找我们的笔记、草稿、头脑风暴和资源, 我们不仅会浪费宝贵的时间, 还会破坏我们的动力。在 CODE 的每一步, 都有一些习惯可以帮助我们更有条理, 让我们的创造力有空间出现。

### The Mise-en-Place Way to Sustainable Productivity  
可持续生产力的 Mise-en-Place 方式

Consider how chefs work in a commercial kitchen. They have incredibly high demands on both the quality _and_ quantity of their output. Every ingredient in every dish must be nearly perfect—one cold side or undercooked filet and the whole dish can be sent back, and the kitchen might have to produce hundreds of dishes on a busy night.  
想想厨师是如何在商业厨房工作的。他们对产品的质量和数量有着极高的要求。每道菜中的每一种配料都必须近乎完美——一个冷面或未煮熟的菲力牛排, 整道菜都可以送回, 而厨房在繁忙的夜晚可能不得不制作数百道菜。

This fundamental tension—between quality and quantity—is a tension we share as knowledge workers. We also must produce work to an extremely high standard, and we must do it fast, continuously, all year long. We are like sprinters who are also trying to run a marathon.  
这种基本的张力——质量和数量之间的张力——是我们作为知识工作者所共有的张力。我们还必须以极高的标准开展工作, 而且我们必须全年快速、连续地开展工作。我们就像短跑运动员一样, 也在努力跑马拉松。

Chefs have a particular system for accomplishing this daunting feat. It’s called _mise en place_, a culinary philosophy used in restaurants around the world. Developed in France starting in the late 1800s, mise en place is a step-by-step process for producing high-quality food efficiently. Chefs can never afford to stop the whole kitchen just so they can clean up. They learn to keep their workspace clean and organized _in the flow of the meals they are preparing_.  
厨师们有一个特殊的系统来完成这项艰巨的壮举。它被称为 mise en place, 这是一种在世界各地的餐厅中使用的烹饪哲学。 mise en place 从 1800 年代后期开始在法国开发, 是一个循序渐进的过程, 可以高效地生产优质食品。厨师们永远不能只 就让整个厨房停下来清理干净。他们学会在准备饭菜的过程中保持工作空间整洁有序。

In the kitchen, this means small habits like always putting the mixing spoon in the same place so they know where to find it next time; immediately wiping a knife clean after using it so it’s ready for the next cut; or laying out the ingredients in the order they’ll be used so that they serve as placeholders.  
在厨房里, 这意味着一些小习惯, 比如总是把搅拌勺放在同一个地方, 这样他们下次就知道在哪里可以找到它; 使用后立即将刀擦干净, 以便为下一次切割做好准备; 或者按照使用顺序排列成分, 以便它们充当占位符。

Chefs use mise en place—a philosophy and mindset embodied in a set of practical techniques—as their “external brain.”[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch09fn1) It gives them a way to externalize their thinking into their environment and automate the repetitive parts of cooking so they can focus completely on the creative parts.  
厨师们使用 mise en place——一种体现在一系列实用技术中的哲学和思维方式——作为他们的 “外部大脑”。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch09fn1) 它为他们提供了一种方法, 可以将他们的思维外化到他们的环境中, 并使烹饪的重复部分自动化, 这样他们就可以完全专注于创造性的部分。

We have a lot to learn as knowledge workers from the system of mise en place. We likewise have to contend with a deluge of tasks, under uncertain conditions, with tight deadlines. We also receive a constant stream of inputs and requests, have too little time to process them, and face many demands requiring simultaneous attention. For us as well, the only time we have available to maintain our systems is during the execution of our regular work.  
作为知识工作者, 我们可以从管理系统中学到很多东西。同样, 我们必须在不确定的条件下和紧迫的期限内应对大量任务。我们还收到源源不断的输入和请求, 没有足够的时间来处理它们, 并且面临许多需要同时关注的需求。对于我们来说, 我们唯一可以维护我们系统的时间是在执行我们的日常工作期间。

There’s no time that’s magically going to become available for you to stop everything and completely reorganize your digital world. It’s not likely that your manager is going to look kindly on you blocking off a whole day to “get caught up.” Your business won’t last long if you turn customers away because you’re “maintaining your systems.” It’s difficult to find the time to put the world on hold and catch your breath. We tend to notice our systems need maintenance only when they break down, which we then blame on our lack of self-discipline or our failure to be sufficiently productive.  
没有时间可以神奇地让你停止一切并彻底重组你的数字世界。你的经理不太可能会善意地看着你抽出一整天的时间 “赶上进度”。如果你因为“维护你的系统” 而拒绝客户, 你的生意就不会持续太久。很难找到时间让世界停下来喘口气。我们往往会注意到我们的系统只有在发生故障时才需要维护, 然后我们将其归咎于我们缺乏自律或我们未能足够高效。

Building a Second Brain is not just about downloading a new piece of software to get organized at one point in time; it is about adopting a dynamic, flexible system and set of habits to continually access what we need without throwing our environment (and mind) into chaos.  
构建第二大脑不仅仅是下载一个新软件来在某个时间点组织起来; 这是关于 采用一个动态、灵活的系统和一套习惯来持续访问我们需要的东西, 而不会使我们的环境 (和思想) 陷入混乱。

It’s not enough to have inner discipline. We also need to follow an _outer_ discipline—a system of principles and behaviors—to channel our energies, thoughts, and emotions productively. A system that adds some structure to the constantly changing flux of information that we interact with every day.  
仅有内在纪律是不够的。我们还需要遵循一种外在的纪律——一套原则和行为体系——来有效地引导我们的能量、思想和情感。一个为我们每天与之交互的不断变化的信息流添加一些结构的系统。

In this chapter, I will introduce you to three kinds of habits that can be integrated into your routine to ensure your Second Brain remains functional and relevant. Each of these habits creates boundaries—of time, space, and intention—around the states of mind that you want to protect and promote in your life. These boundaries tell you what you should be focusing on, and just as importantly, what you should ignore. The three habits most important to your Second Brain include:  
在本章中, 我将向您介绍三种可以融入日常生活的习惯, 以确保您的第二大脑保持功能和相关性。这些习惯中的每一个都围绕着你想要在生活中保护和促进的心态创造了时间、空间和意图的界限。这些界限告诉你应该关注什么, 同样重要的是, 你应该忽略什么。对您的第二大脑最重要的三个习惯包括:

*   **Project Checklists:** Ensure you start and finish your projects in a consistent way, making use of past work.  
    项目清单: 确保您以一致的方式开始和完成您的项目, 利用过去的工作。
*   **Weekly and Monthly Reviews:** Periodically review your work and life and decide if you want to change anything.  
    每周和每月回顾: 定期回顾你的工作和生活, 并决定是否要改变什么。
*   **Noticing Habits:** Notice small opportunities to edit, highlight, or move notes to make them more discoverable for your future self.  
    注意习惯: 注意编辑、突出显示或移动笔记的小机会, 让未来的自己更容易发现它们。

You can think of these habits as the “maintenance schedule” of your Second Brain. Just like you have a maintenance schedule for your car, which advises you to regularly change the oil, rotate the tires, and change the air filters, your Second Brain occasionally needs a tune-up to ensure it’s in good working order.  
您可以将这些习惯视为第二大脑的 “维护计划”。就像您的汽车有一个维护计划, 建议您定期更换机油、换轮胎和更换空气滤清器一样, 您的第二大脑偶尔也需要进行调整以确保其处于良好的工作状态。

Let’s explore these habits one at a time.  
让我们一次一个地探索这些习惯。

### The Project Checklist Habit: The Key to Starting Your Knowledge Flywheel  
项目清单习惯: 启动知识飞轮的关键

At the most basic level, knowledge work is about taking in information and then turning it into results. All day, every day we are consuming and then producing. You don’t need special training to perform these activities, and you certainly don’t need a Second Brain.  
在最基本的层面上, 知识工作就是获取信息, 然后将其转化为结果。我们每天都在消费, 然后生产。你不需要特殊的训练来进行这些活动, 你当然不需要第二大脑。

What most people are missing, however, is a feedback loop—a way to “recycle” the knowledge that was created as part of past efforts so it can be used in future ones as well. This is how investors think about money: they don’t get the profits from one investment and immediately spend it all. They reinvest it back into other investments, creating a flywheel so their money builds on itself over time.  
然而, 大多数人缺少的是反馈循环——一种 “回收” 作为过去努力的一部分而创造的知识的方法, 以便它也可以用于未来的努力。这就是投资者对金钱的看法: 他们不会从一项投资中获得利润并立即花光所有。他们将其重新投资到其他投资中, 形成一个飞轮, 这样他们的钱就会随着时间的推移自行积累。

This is exactly how I want you to treat your attention—as an asset that gets invested and produces a return, which in turn can be reinvested back into other ventures. This is how you can ensure your knowledge grows and compounds over time like a high-yield asset. Like investing a small amount in the stock market every month, your investments of attention can likewise compound as your knowledge grows and your ideas connect and build on each other.  
这正是我希望你对待你的注意力的方式——作为一种可以投资并产生回报的资产, 反过来又可以将其再投资回其他企业。这就是您如何确保您的知识像高收益资产一样随着时间的推移而增长和复合。就像每个月在股票市场上投资少量一样, 随着知识的增长以及想法的相互联系和相互借鉴, 您的注意力投资同样会增加。

If you look closely, there are two key moments in this process of recycling knowledge. Two places where the paths diverge, and you have the chance to do something different than you’ve done before.  
如果仔细观察, 在这个回收知识的过程中有两个关键时刻。路径分叉的两个地方, 你有机会做一些与以前不同的事情。

Those two moments are when a project starts, and when it finishes. For the former, I’ll introduce you to the Project Kickoff Checklist, and for the latter, the Project Completion Checklist.  
这两个时刻是项目开始和结束的时间。对于前者, 我将向您介绍项目启动清单, 对于后者, 我将向您介绍项目完成清单。

#### Checklist #1: Project Kickoff 清单 #1: 项目启动

Before they taxi onto the runway and take off, airline pilots run through a “preflight checklist” that tells them everything they need to check or do. It ensures they complete all the necessary steps without having to rely on their unreliable brains.  
在他们滑行到跑道并起飞之前, 航空公司飞行员会检查 “飞行前检查清单”, 告诉他们需要检查或做的一切。它确保他们完成所有必要的步骤, 而不必依赖他们不可靠的大脑。

The way most people launch projects, in contrast, can be described as “haphazardly.” They might look through their existing notes and files for any information that might be relevant, or they might not. They might talk to their colleagues about any lessons from past experience, or they might not. They might create a plan to guide their progress, or they might not. The successful start of the project is more or less left to chance.  
相比之下, 大多数人启动项目的方式可以用 “随意” 来形容。他们可能会查看现有的笔记和 文件, 寻找任何可能相关的信息, 也可能不相关。他们可能会与同事谈论过去经验中的任何教训, 也可能不会。他们可能会制定计划来指导他们的进步, 也可能不会。该项目的成功启动或多或少是偶然的。

In Chapter 5 we saw how work is becoming ever more project-centric. Every goal, collaboration, or assignment we take on can be defined as a project, which gives it shape, focus, and a sense of direction. If we consider that these projects are our biggest investments of attention, it’s worth adding a little bit of structure to how we start them. This is where the Project Kickoff Checklist comes in.  
在第 5 章中, 我们看到了工作如何变得越来越以项目为中心。我们承担的每一个目标、协作或任务都可以定义为一个项目, 它赋予它形状、重点和方向感。如果我们认为这些项目是我们最大的注意力投资, 那么在我们如何启动它们时增加一点结构是值得的。这就是项目启动清单的用武之地。

Here’s my own checklist: 这是我自己的清单:

1.  **Capture** my current thinking on the project.  
    捕捉我当前对该项目的想法。
2.  **Review** folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.  
    查看可能包含相关注释的文件夹 (或标签)。
3.  **Search** for related terms across all folders.  
    在所有文件夹中搜索相关术语。
4.  **Move** (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.  
    将相关注释移动 (或标记) 到项目文件夹中。
5.  **Create** an outline of collected notes and plan the project.  
    创建收集的笔记大纲并计划项目。

1. **Capture my current thinking on the project.** I often find that the moment a project begins to form in my mind, I start to have ideas and opinions about it. I like to start by creating a blank note and doing a brainstorm of any thoughts that come to mind. This first note is then placed inside a new project folder dedicated to storing all the notes I’ll be creating related to it.  
1. 捕捉我当前对项目的想法。我经常发现, 当一个项目开始在我脑海中形成的那一刻, 我就开始对它产生想法和意见。我喜欢先创建一个空白笔记, 然后对脑海中浮现的任何想法进行头脑风暴。然后将第一个笔记放在一个新的项目文件夹中, 该文件夹专门用于存储我将创建的所有与之相关的笔记。

This step can and should be messy: I pour out all my random musings, potential approaches, links to other ideas or topics, or reminders of people to talk to.  
这一步可以而且应该是混乱的: 我会倾诉我所有的随机想法、可能的方法、与其他想法或主题的链接, 或者提醒可以与之交谈的人。

Here are some questions I use to prompt this initial brainstorm:  
以下是我用来提示这次初步头脑风暴的一些问题:

*   What do I already know about this project?  
    关于这个项目我已经知道了什么?
*   What don’t I know that I need to find out?  
    我不知道我需要找出什么?
*   What is my goal or intention?  
    我的目标或意图是什么?
*   Who can I talk to who might provide insights?  
    我可以与谁交谈, 谁可以提供见解?
*   What can I read or listen to for relevant ideas?  
    我可以阅读或收听哪些相关想法?

Anything that comes to mind from these questions I write down in my starting note. I prefer using bullet points so the information is compact and can easily be moved around.  
从这些问题中想到的任何事情, 我都会写在我的开始笔记中。我更喜欢使用项目符号, 这样信息紧凑并且可以轻松移动。

2. **Review folders (or tags) that might contain relevant notes.** Second, I look through any existing folders that might contain information relevant to the new project I’m starting, including related templates, outlines, and outtakes from previous projects. PARA and Progressive Summarization really come in handy here: I already have a variety of folders, each containing a curated set of notes, highlighted and summarized so I can rapidly recall what they’re about. I choose a handful of folders that seem most relevant to what I’m starting, including in projects, areas, resources, and archives. Then I quickly scan any notes inside that look interesting, taking care to keep the momentum going so I don’t get bogged down anywhere. Now is not the time to go on tangents that will only distract me from moving forward.  
2. 查看可能包含相关注释的文件夹 (或标签)。其次, 我查看所有可能包含与我正在开始的新项目相关的信息的现有文件夹, 包括相关模板、大纲和以前项目的摘录。 PARA 和 Progressive Summarization 在这里真的派上了用场: 我已经有各种各样的文件夹, 每个文件夹都包含一组精选的笔记, 突出显示和总结, 这样我就可以快速回忆起它们的内容。我选择了一些看起来与我开始的内容最相关的文件夹, 包括项目、区域、资源和档案。然后我快速浏览里面所有看起来有趣的笔记, 注意保持势头, 这样我就不会在任何地方陷入困境。现在不是走岔路的时候, 那只会分散我前进的注意力。

3. **Search for related terms across all folders.** The third step is to perform searches for any notes I might have missed. Sometimes there are valuable ideas buried in unexpected places, which I may not find through browsing alone.  
3. 在所有文件夹中搜索相关术语。第三步是搜索我可能遗漏的任何笔记。有时在意想不到的地方埋藏着有价值的想法, 我可能无法通过单独浏览找到它们。

This is where the Curator’s Perspective I used when I first captured the content really pays off—because each and every note in my Second Brain was deliberately chosen, I am able to search through a collection of exclusively high-quality notes free of fluff and filler. This is in stark contrast to searching the open Internet, which is full of distracting ads, misleading headlines, superficial content, and pointless controversy, all of which can throw me off track.  
这就是我在第一次捕捉内容时使用的策展人视角真正得到回报的地方——因为我的第二大脑中的每一个笔记都是有意选择的, 我能够搜索 a 完全免费的高质量笔记集合绒毛和填料。这与在开放的互联网上搜索形成鲜明对比, 互联网上充斥着分散注意力的广告、误导性的标题、肤浅的内容和毫无意义的争论, 所有这些都会让我偏离正轨。

I run a series of searches for terms related to the new project, scanning the results and quickly jumping into any note that seems relevant. Progressive Summarization helps here too, enabling me to zoom into and out of notes without having to absorb their full contents.  
我对与新项目相关的术语进行了一系列搜索, 扫描结果并快速跳转到任何看起来相关的注释。渐进式总结在这里也有帮助, 使我能够放大和缩小笔记, 而不必吸收它们的全部内容。

4. **Move (or tag) relevant notes to the project folder.** Fourth, any notes found in the previous two steps I move to the project folder, titled after the name of the new project I’m starting. Alternatively, depending on the capabilities of your notes app, you can also tag or link any relevant notes with the project, so you don’t have to move them from their original location. The important thing isn’t where a note is located, but whether you can reference it quickly while staying focused on the project at hand.  
4. 将相关注释移动 (或标记) 到项目文件夹中。第四, 我将在前两个步骤中找到的所有注释移至项目文件夹, 以我开始的新项目的名称命名。或者, 根据您的笔记应用程序的功能, 您还可以标记或链接任何与项目相关的笔记, 这样您就不必将它们从原来的位置移动。重要的不是笔记的位置, 而是您是否可以在专注于手头项目的同时快速参考它。

5. **Create an outline of collected notes and plan the project.** Finally, it’s time to pull together the material I’ve gathered and create an outline (an Archipelago of Ideas) for the project. My goal is to end up not just with a loose collection of ideas. It is to formulate a logical progression of steps that make it clear what I should do next.  
5. 创建收集的笔记大纲并计划项目。最后, 是时候整理我收集的材料并为项目创建大纲 (想法群岛) 了。我的目标是最终不只是一堆松散的想法。它是制定一个合乎逻辑的步骤进展, 使我清楚我下一步应该做什么。

The form this outline takes depends on the nature of the project. If it is a piece of writing such as an essay or report, the outline might be the main points or headings I want to include in the final piece. If it is a document outlining a collaborative project with colleagues or outside contractors, the outline might include the objectives we’re working toward and tentative responsibilities for each person. If it is a trip I’m planning to take, it might be a packing list and itinerary.  
该大纲采用的形式取决于项目的性质。如果它是一篇文章, 如论文或报告, 大纲可能是我想在最后一篇文章中包含的要点或标题。如果它是概述与同事或外部承包商的合作项目的文件, 则该大纲可能包括我们正在努力实现的目标以及每个人的暂定职责。如果这是我计划进行的旅行, 它可能是装箱单和行程单。

The important thing to remember as you move through this checklist is that you are making a plan for how to tackle the project, _not executing the project itself_. You should think of this five-step checklist as a first pass, taking no more than twenty to thirty minutes. You’re only trying to get a sense of what kind of material you already have in your Second Brain. Once you do, you’ll have a much better sense of how much time it will take, which knowledge or resources you’ll need access to, and what your challenges will likely be.  
在浏览此清单时要记住的重要一点是, 您正在制定如何处理项目的计划, 而不是执行项目本身。您应该将这个五步检查表视为第一步, 所用时间不超过 20 到 30 分钟。你只是想了解你的第二大脑中已经拥有什么样的材料。一旦你这样做了, 你就会更好地了解这需要多少时间, 你需要访问哪些知识或资源, 以及你可能面临的挑战。

I encourage you to use my kickoff checklist as a starting point and customize it over time as you understand how it fits into your own context. Depending on your profession or industry, you might need more or less formality, more or less time for a first pass, and more or fewer people involved. Here are some other options for actions you might want to include in your own version:  
我鼓励您使用我的启动清单作为起点, 并随着时间的推移对其进行自定义, 因为您了解它如何适合您自己的环境。根据您的职业或行业, 您可能需要或多或少的正式手续、或多或少的第一次通过时间以及或多或少的参与人员。以下是您可能希望包含在您自己的版本中的一些其他操作选项:

*   **Answer premortem**[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-004) **questions:** What do you want to learn? What is the greatest source of uncertainty or most important question you want to answer? What is most likely to fail?  
    回答事前 [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-004) 问题: 你想学什么? 最大的不确定性来源或您想回答的最重要的问题是什么? 什么最有可能失败?
*   **Communicate with stakeholders:** Explain to your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., what the project is about and why it matters.  
    与利益相关者沟通: 向您的经理、同事、客户、客户、股东、承包商等解释项目的内容及其重要性。
*   **Define success criteria:** What needs to happen for this project to be considered successful? What are the minimum results you need to achieve, or the “stretch goals” you’re striving for?  
    定义成功标准: 这个项目需要发生什么才能被认为是成功的? 您需要达到的最低结果是什么, 或者您正在努力争取的 “延伸目标” 是什么?
*   **Have an official kickoff:** Schedule check-in calls, make a budget and timeline, and write out the goals and objectives to make sure everyone is informed, aligned, and clear on what is expected of them. I find that doing an official kickoff is useful even if it’s a solo project!  
    正式启动: 安排签到电话, 制定预算和时间表, 并写下目标和目标, 以确保每个人都了解情况、保持一致并清楚他们的 期望是什么。我发现正式启动很有用, 即使它是一个单独的项目!

#### Checklist #2: Project Completion 清单 #2: 项目完成

Now let’s take a look at the Project Completion Checklist, the other side of the equation.  
现在让我们看一下项目完成清单, 等式的另一边。

The completion of a project is a very special time in a knowledge worker’s life because it’s one of the rare moments when something actually ends. Part of what makes modern work so challenging is that nothing ever seems to finish. It’s exhausting, isn’t it? Calls and meetings seem to stretch on forever, which means we rarely get to celebrate a clear-cut victory and start fresh. This is one of the best reasons to keep our projects small: so that we get to feel a fulfilling sense of completion as often as possible.  
项目的完成是知识工作者生活中非常特殊的时刻, 因为它是某些事情真正结束的罕见时刻之一。现代工作之所以如此具有挑战性, 部分原因在于似乎没有什么事情可以完成。这很累, 不是吗? 电话和会议似乎永远持续下去, 这意味着我们很少能够庆祝明确的胜利并重新开始。这是让我们的项目保持小型化的最佳理由之一: 这样我们才能尽可能多地感受到完成的成就感。

We don’t want to limit ourselves to merely celebrating the end of a project. We want to learn from the experience and document any thinking that could add value in the future. This is where the Project Completion Checklist is essential. It’s a series of steps you can take to decide if there are any reusable knowledge assets worth keeping, before archiving the rest. The only way that the Kickoff Checklist we just looked at will be feasible is if you’ve previously taken the time to save and preserve material from past projects.  
我们不想将自己局限于仅仅庆祝项目的结束。我们希望从经验中学习并记录任何可以在未来增加价值的想法。这是项目完成清单必不可少的地方。这是您可以采取的一系列步骤, 以确定是否有任何值得保留的可重用知识资产, 然后再归档其余部分。我们刚刚看到的启动清单唯一可行的方法是, 如果您以前花时间保存和保存过去项目的材料。

Here’s my checklist: 这是我的清单:

1.  **Mark** project as complete in task manager or project management app.  
    在任务管理器或项目管理应用程序中将项目标记为完成。
2.  **Cross out** the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section.  
    划掉相关的项目目标并移至 “已完成” 部分。
3.  **Review** Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders.  
    查看中间数据包并将它们移动到其他文件夹。
4.  **Move** project to archives across all platforms.  
    跨所有平台将项目移动到存档。
5.  **If project is becoming inactive:** add a current status note to the project folder before archiving.  
    If project is becoming inactive: 在归档之前将当前状态注释添加到项目文件夹。

1. **Mark project as complete in task manager or project management app.** This is the first step is making sure the project is in fact finished. Often there are a few lingering tasks needed to completely wrap it up—such as getting final approvals, filing paperwork, or disseminating the project deliverables—which is why I start by looking at my task manager. A task manager is a dedicated app for keeping track of pending actions, like a digital to-do list.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-003)  
1. 在任务管理器或项目管理应用程序中将项目标记为完成。这是确保项目实际完成的第一步。通常需要完成一些挥之不去的任务才能将其完全结束——例如获得最终批准、归档文件或传播项目可交付成果——这就是为什么我首先查看我的任务经理。任务管理器是一个专门用于跟踪未决操作的应用程序, 例如数字待办事项列表。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-003)

If all the tasks I find there are done, I can mark it as complete and move on to the following steps.  
如果我找到的所有任务都已完成, 我可以将其标记为完成并继续执行以下步骤。

2. **Cross out the associated project goal and move to “Completed” section.** Each project I work on usually has a corresponding goal. I keep all my goals in a single digital note, sorted from short-term goals for the next year to long-term goals for years to come.  
2. 划掉相关的项目目标并转到 “已完成” 部分。我从事的每个项目通常都有一个相应的目标。我把我所有的目标都保存在一个数字笔记中, 从明年的短期目标到未来几年的长期目标。

I like to take a moment and reflect on whether the goal I initially set for this project panned out. If I successfully achieved it, what factors led to that success? How can I repeat or double down on those strengths? If I fell short, what happened? What can I learn or change to avoid making the same mistakes next time? The amount of time you spend thinking about these questions depends on the size of the project. A massive team endeavor might justify hours of in-depth analysis, while a small personal side project might deserve only a few minutes of reflection.  
我喜欢花点时间反思一下我最初为这个项目设定的目标是否实现了。如果我成功实现了它, 是什么因素导致了成功? 我怎样才能重复或加倍发挥这些优势? 如果我失败了, 会发生什么? 我可以学习或改变什么以避免下次犯同样的错误? 您花在思考这些问题上的时间取决于项目的规模。一个巨大的团队努力可能需要数小时的深入分析, 而一个小的个人项目可能只需要几分钟的思考。

I also like to cross out the goal and move it to a different section called “Completed.” Any time I need some motivation, I can look through this list and be reminded of all the meaningful goals I’ve achieved in the past. It doesn’t matter if the goal is big or small—keeping an inventory of your victories and successes is a wonderful use for your Second Brain.  
我还喜欢划掉目标并将其移至名为 “已完成” 的不同部分。每当我需要一些动力时, 我都可以浏览这份清单, 并想起我过去实现的所有有意义的目标。目标是大是小并不重要——记录你的胜利和成功对你的第二大脑来说是一个很好的用途。

3. **Review Intermediate Packets and move them to other folders.** Third, I’ll look through the folder for the completed project to identify any Intermediate Packets I created that could be repurposed in the future. This could include a web-page design to be used as a template for future sites, an agenda for a one-on-one performance review, or a series of interview questions that might come in handy for future hires.  
3. 查看中间数据包并将它们移动到其他文件夹。第三, 我将查看已完成项目的文件夹, 以确定我创建的任何可以在未来重新利用的中间数据包。这可能包括用作未来网站模板的网页设计、一对一绩效评估的议程, 或一系列可能对未来雇员派上用场的面试问题。

It takes a certain lens to see each of these documents and files not as disposable, but as tangible by-products of quality thinking. Much of our work gets repeated over time with slight variations. If you can start your thinking where you left off last time, you’ll be far ahead compared to starting from zero every time.  
需要一定的镜头才能看到这些文档和文件中的每一个都不是一次性的, 而是质量思维的有形副产品。随着时间的推移, 我们的大部分工作都会重复进行, 但会有细微的变化。如果你能从上次停下来的地方开始思考, 那么与每次都从零开始相比, 你会遥遥领先。

Any IPs I decide could be relevant to another project, I move to that project’s folder. The same goes for notes relevant to areas or resources. This is a forgiving decision, and it’s okay if you don’t catch every single one. The full contents of everything you archive away will always show up in future searches, so you don’t have to worry that anything will be lost.  
我决定的任何 IP 可能与另一个项目相关, 我移动到该项目的文件夹。与区域或资源相关的注释也是如此。这是一个宽容的决定, 如果你没有抓住每一个也没关系。您存档的所有内容的完整内容将始终显示在以后的搜索中, 因此您不必担心会丢失任何内容。

4. **Move project to archives across all platforms.** Fourth, it’s time to move the project folder to the archives in my notes app, as well as any other platforms I used during the project. For me, this usually includes my computer’s documents folder and my cloud storage drive.  
4. 将项目移动到所有平台的档案中。第四, 是时候将项目文件夹移动到我的笔记应用程序以及我在项目期间使用的任何其他平台的档案中了。对我来说, 这通常包括我电脑的文档文件夹和我的云存储驱动器。

This move ensures that your list of active projects doesn’t get cluttered with old, obsolete stuff from the past while also preserving every bit of material just in case it unexpectedly becomes relevant in the future.  
此举确保您的活动项目列表不会被过去的旧的、过时的东西弄得乱七八糟, 同时还保留每一点材料, 以防它在未来意外变得相关。

5. **If project is becoming inactive: add a current status note to the project folder before archiving.** The fifth step applies only if the project is getting canceled, postponed, or put on hold instead of completed. I still want to archive it so it’s out of sight, but in this special case, there’s one final action I take.  
5. 如果项目变为非活动状态: 在存档前将当前状态注释添加到项目文件夹。第五步仅适用于项目被取消、推迟或搁置而不是完成的情况。我仍然想将其存档以使其不可见, 但在这种特殊情况下, 我将采取最后一项措施。

I add a new note to the project folder titled “Current status,” and jot down a few comments so I can pick it back up in the future. For example, in a few bullet points I might describe the last actions I took, details on why it was postponed or canceled, who was working on it and what role they played, and any lessons or best practices learned. This Hemingway Bridge gives me the confidence to put the project on ice knowing I can bring it back to life anytime.  
我在项目文件夹中添加了一个名为 “当前状态” 的新注释, 并记下了一些评论, 以便将来可以取回它。例如, 在几个要点中, 我可能会描述我最近采取的行动、推迟或取消原因的详细信息、谁在从事这项工作以及他们扮演什么角色, 以及学到的任何教训或最佳实践。这座海明威大桥让我有信心将这个项目搁置一旁, 因为我知道我可以随时让它恢复生机。

I’ve been amazed that by being honest with myself about when a project has stalled and taking these few minutes to download my current thinking on it, I can often pick it back up months or even years later with minimal effort. It’s very empowering to realize you can put a project in “cold storage” and let go of the mental toll of having to keep it in mind. It’s tremendously comforting to know that I don’t need to make constant progress on everything all the time.  
令我惊讶的是, 通过对自己诚实地了解项目何时停滞并花几分钟下载我当前的想法, 我通常可以在数月甚至数年后以最小的努力将其恢复。意识到您可以将一个项目放入 “冷藏库” 并摆脱必须牢记它的精神损失, 这是非常有力量的。知道我不需要一直在每件事上不断取得进步, 这让我感到非常欣慰。

Here are some other items you can include on your Project Completion Checklist. I encourage you to personalize it for your own needs:  
以下是您可以包含在项目完成清单中的其他一些项目。我鼓励您根据自己的需要对其进行个性化设置:

*   **Answer postmortem questions:** What did you learn? What did you do well? What could you have done better? What can you improve for next time?  
    回答事后分析问题: 你学到了什么? 你做了什么好事? 你可以做得更好吗? 下次可以改进什么?
*   **Communicate with stakeholders:** Notify your manager, colleagues, clients, customers, shareholders, contractors, etc., that the project is complete and what the outcomes were.  
    与利益相关者沟通: 通知你的经理、同事、客户、客户、股东、承包商等, 项目已经完成, 结果如何。
*   **Evaluate success criteria:** Were the objectives of the project achieved? Why or why not? What was the return on investment?  
    评估成功标准: 项目的目标是否实现? 为什么或者为什么不? 投资回报是多少?
*   **Officially close out the project and celebrate:** Send any last emails, invoices, receipts, feedback forms, or documents, and celebrate your accomplishments with your team or collaborators so you receive the feeling of fulfillment for all the effort you put in.  
    正式结束项目并庆祝: 发送任何最后的电子邮件、发票、收据、反馈表或文件, 并与你的团队或合作者一起庆祝你的成就, 这样你就会对你付出的所有努力感到满足。

The first pass on your Project Completion Checklist should be completed in even less time than the Project Kickoff Checklist—no more than ten or fifteen minutes to grab any stand-alone materials and insights. Since you don’t know for sure that any of this material will ever be useful again, you should minimize how much extra time and attention you invest in it. Put in just enough effort that your future self will be able to decide if the material is relevant to their needs. If it is, then they can decide in that moment whether to invest the effort to further organize and distill it.  
项目完成检查表的第一遍应该比项目启动检查表的时间更短——不超过十到十五分钟来获取任何独立的材料和见解。由于您不确定这些材料中的任何一个是否会再次有用, 因此您应该尽量减少投入在其中的额外时间和注意力。付出足够的努力, 你未来的自己将能够决定这些材料是否与他们的需求相关。如果是, 那么他们可以在那一刻决定是否投入精力进一步组织和提炼它。

The purpose of using project checklists isn’t to make the way you work rigid and formulaic. It is to help you start and finish projects cleanly and decisively, so you don’t have “orphaned” commitments that linger on with no end in sight. Think of these checklists as scaffolding—a supporting structure that ensures what you’re building can stand on its own. Just as scaffolding eventually gets taken down, these habits will get absorbed into the way you think and become completely second nature. You won’t even consider starting something new without querying your Second Brain to see if there is any material you can reuse.  
使用项目清单的目的不是让你的工作方式变得死板和公式化。它是为了帮助您干净利落、果断地开始和完成项目, 这样您就不会有 “孤立的” 承诺, 这些承诺挥之不去, 看不到尽头。将这些清单视为脚手架——一种确保您正在构建的内容能够独立站立的支撑结构。正如脚手架最终会被拆除一样, 这些习惯也会被吸收到你的思维方式中, 并完全成为第二天性。如果不询问你的第二大脑, 看看是否有任何材料可以重复使用, 你甚至不会考虑开始新事物。

### The Review Habit: Why You Should Batch Process Your Notes (and How Often)  
复习习惯: 为什么你应该批处理你的笔记 (以及多久处理一次)

Next let’s talk about Weekly and Monthly Reviews.  
接下来我们来说说周评和月评。

The practice of conducting a “Weekly Review” was pioneered by executive coach and author David Allen in his influential book _Getting Things Done_.[III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-002) He described a Weekly Review as a regular check-in, performed once a week, in which you intentionally reset and review your work and life. Allen recommends using a Weekly Review to write down any new to-dos, review your active projects, and decide on priorities for the upcoming week.  
进行 “每周回顾” 的做法是由执行教练和作家大卫 · 艾伦在他颇具影响力的著作《把事情做好》中开创的。 [III](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-002) 他将 Weekly Review 描述为定期检查, 每周执行一次, 您有意识地重新设置和检查您的工作和生活。艾伦建议使用每周回顾来写下任何新的待办事项, 回顾你的活动项目, 并决定下一周的优先事项。

I suggest adding one more step: review the notes you’ve created over the past week, give them succinct titles that tell you what’s inside, and sort them into the appropriate PARA folders. Most notes apps have an “inbox” of some kind where new notes collect until they’re ready to be reviewed. This “batch processing” takes only seconds per note, and you can complete it within a few minutes.  
我建议再添加一个步骤: 回顾你在过去一周创建的笔记, 给它们起一个简洁的标题, 告诉你里面有什么, 然后将它们分类到适当的 PARA 文件夹中。大多数笔记应用程序都有一个某种类型的 “收件箱”, 用于收集新笔记, 直到它们准备好接受审查。这种“批处理” 每个音符只需要几秒钟, 你可以在几分钟内完成。

Let’s dive into the details and see how Weekly and Monthly Reviews can help you maintain your Second Brain in a state of readiness for whatever arrives at your doorstep.  
让我们深入了解细节, 看看每周和每月回顾如何帮助您保持第二大脑处于准备状态, 以应对任何到达您家门口的事情。

#### A Weekly Review Template: Reset to Avoid Overwhelm  
每周回顾模板: 重置以避免不知所措

Here is my own Weekly Review Checklist, which I usually complete every three to seven days depending on how busy a given week is. The point isn’t to follow a rigid schedule, but to make it a habit to empty my inboxes and clear my digital workspaces on a regular basis to keep them from getting overwhelmed. I keep this checklist on a digital sticky note on my computer, so I can easily refer to it.  
这是我自己的每周回顾清单, 我通常每三到七天完成一次, 具体取决于给定一周的忙碌程度。关键不是要遵循严格的时间表, 而是要养成定期清空 my 收件箱并清理我的数字工作区的习惯, 以免它们变得不堪重负。我将这份清单保存在我电脑上的数字便条上, 这样我就可以很容易地参考它。

1.  Clear my email inbox. 清除我的电子邮件收件箱。
2.  Check my calendar. 检查我的日历。
3.  Clear my computer desktop. 清理我的电脑桌面。
4.  Clear my notes inbox. 清除我的笔记收件箱。
5.  Choose my tasks for the week.  
    选择我本周的任务。

1. **Clear my email inbox.** I start by clearing my email inbox of any emails lingering from the past week. I don’t usually have time to do this during the week in the rush of my other priorities, but I’ve found that if I let messages accumulate from one week to the next, it makes it hard to figure out what’s new and requires action and what’s left over from the past.  
1. 清除我的电子邮件收件箱。我首先清除我的电子邮件收件箱中过去一周遗留下来的所有电子邮件。我通常没有时间在一周内忙于处理其他优先事项, 但我发现如果我让消息从一个星期累积到下一个星期, 就很难弄清楚什么是新的和需要的行动以及过去遗留下来的东西。

Any action items I find get saved in my task manager, and any notes I capture get saved in my notes app.  
我找到的任何行动项目都会保存在我的任务管理器中, 我捕获的任何笔记都会保存在我的笔记应用程序中。

2. **Check my calendar.** Next, I check my calendar. This is the landscape of my week, showing me the meetings and appointments I need to make room for. I typically look at the last couple of weeks in case there’s anything I need to follow up on, and the upcoming couple of weeks in case there’s anything I need to prepare for.  
2. 检查我的日历。接下来, 我检查我的日历。这是我一周的风景, 向我展示了我需要腾出空间的会议和约会。我通常会查看过去几周, 以防有任何我需要跟进的事情, 以及接下来的几周, 以防有任何我需要准备的事情。

Once again, anything I need to act on gets saved in my task manager, and any notes get captured in my notes app.  
再一次, 我需要做的任何事情都会保存在我的任务管理器中, 所有笔记都会被记录在我的笔记应用程序中。

3. **Clear my computer desktop.** Next, I clear the files that have accumulated on my computer desktop. I’ve found that if I let them accumulate week after week, eventually my digital environment gets so cluttered that I can’t think straight.  
3. 清空我的电脑桌面。接下来, 我清除电脑桌面上堆积的文件。我发现, 如果我让它们一周又一周地积累, 最终我的数字环境会变得非常混乱, 以至于我无法理清思路。

Any files potentially relevant to my projects, areas, or resources get moved to the appropriate PARA folders in my computer’s file system.  
任何可能与我的项目、区域或资源相关的文件都将移动到我计算机文件系统中相应的 PARA 文件夹中。

4. **Clear my notes inbox.** By the time I get to the fourth step, the inbox in my notes app is chock-full of interesting tidbits from the previous three steps—from my email, calendar, and computer desktop. Plus all the other notes I’ve collected over the course of the preceding week, which usually totals between five and fifteen new notes in an average week.  
4. 清除我的笔记收件箱。当我进行到第四步时, 我的笔记应用程序的收件箱里塞满了前三个步骤的有趣花絮——来自我的电子邮件、日历和电脑桌面。加上我在前一周收集的所有其他笔记, 平均每周通常总共有五到十五篇新笔记。

At this point I’ll batch process them all at once, making quick, intuitive decisions about which of the PARA folders each note might be relevant to, and creating new folders as needed. There is no “correct” location for a given note, and search is incredibly effective, so I put it in the first place that occurs to me.  
此时, 我将一次性对它们进行批处理, 快速、直观地决定每个笔记可能与哪些 PARA 文件夹相关, 并根据需要创建新文件夹。给定的笔记没有 “正确” 的位置, 搜索非常有效, 所以我把它放在我想到的第一位。

You’ll notice that this is the only step in my Weekly Review that is directly related to my digital notes. It is a simple and practical process of going through my notes inbox, giving each note an informative title, and moving them into the appropriate PARA folders. I don’t highlight or summarize them. I don’t try to understand or absorb their contents. I don’t worry about all the topics they could potentially relate to.  
你会注意到这是我的每周回顾中唯一与我的数字笔记直接相关的步骤。通过我的笔记收件箱, 为每条笔记赋予一个信息丰富的标题, 并将它们移动到适当的 PARA 文件夹中, 这是一个简单实用的过程。我没有强调或总结它们。我不试图理解或吸收它们的内容。我不担心他们可能涉及的所有主题。

I want to save all that thinking for the future—for a time and place when I know what I’m trying to accomplish and am seeking a knowledge building block to help me get there faster. This weekly sorting process serves as a light reminder of the knowledge I’ve accumulated over the past week, and ensures I have a healthy flow of new ideas and insights flowing into my Second Brain.  
我想把所有的想法都留到未来——在某个时间和地点, 当我知道我正在努力完成什么, 并且正在寻找一个知识构建块来帮助我更快地到达那里时。这个每周一次的分类过程可以提醒我过去一周积累的知识, 并确保我有健康的新想法和新见解流入我的第二大脑。

5. **Choose my tasks for the week.** There’s one final step in my Weekly Review. It’s time to clear the inbox in my task manager app. By this point, there are likewise a number of tasks that I’ve captured from my email, calendar, desktop, and notes, and I take a few minutes to sort them into the appropriate projects and areas.  
5. 选择我本周的任务。我的每周回顾还有最后一步。是时候清除我的任务管理器应用程序中的收件箱了。至此, 我还从我的 电子邮件、日历、桌面和笔记中捕获了一些任务, 我花了几分钟将它们分类到适当的项目和区域中。

The final step of my Weekly Review is to select the tasks I’m committing to for the upcoming week. Because I’ve just completed a sweep of my entire digital world and taken into account every piece of potentially relevant information, I can make this decision decisively and begin my week with total confidence that I’m working on the right things.  
我的每周回顾的最后一步是选择我要为下一周承诺的任务。因为我刚刚扫描了我的整个数字世界并考虑了每一条可能相关的信息, 所以我可以果断地做出这个决定并开始新的一周, 完全相信我正在做正确的事情。

#### A Monthly Review Template: Reflect for Clarity and Control  
月度审查模板: 反映清晰度和控制力

While the Weekly Review is grounded and practical, I recommend doing a Monthly Review that is a bit more reflective and holistic. It’s a chance to evaluate the big picture and consider more fundamental changes to your goals, priorities, and systems that you might not have the chance to think about in the busyness of the day-to-day.  
虽然每周回顾是扎实和实用的, 但我建议做一个更具反思性和整体性的每月回顾。这是一个评估大局并考虑对您的目标、优先事项和系统进行更根本性改变的机会, 这些是您在忙碌的日常工作中可能没有机会考虑的。

Here’s mine: 这是我的:

1.  Review and update my goals. 回顾并更新我的目标。
2.  Review and update my project list.  
    查看并更新我的项目列表。
3.  Review my areas of responsibility.  
    审查我的职责范围。
4.  Review someday/maybe tasks. 回顾某天 / 也许任务。

1. **Review and update my goals.** I start by reviewing my goals for the quarter and the year. I ask myself questions like “What successes or accomplishments did I have?” and “What went unexpectedly and what can I learn from it?” I’ll take some time to cross off any completed goals, add any new ones that have emerged, or change the scope of goals that no longer make sense.  
1. 回顾并更新我的目标。我首先回顾我的季度和年度目标。我问自己这样的问题:“我取得了哪些成功或成就?”和 “出乎意料的事情发生了什么, 我可以从中学到什么?” 我会花一些时间划掉所有已完成的目标, 添加任何新出现的目标, 或者更改不再有意义的目标范围。

2. **Review and update my project list.** Next, I’ll review and update my project list. This includes archiving any completed or canceled projects, adding any new ones, or updating active projects to reflect how they’ve changed. I will also update the folders in my notes app to reflect these changes.  
2。查看并更新我的项目列表。接下来, 我将审查并更新我的项目列表。这包括归档任何已完成或取消的项目、添加任何新项目或更新活动项目以反映它们的变化情况。我还将更新我的笔记应用程序中的文件夹以反映这些更改。

It’s important that the project list remains a current, timely, and accurate reflection of your real-life goals and priorities. Especially since projects are the central organizing principle of your Second Brain. When you have a project folder ready and waiting, your mind is primed to notice and capture the best ideas to move it forward.  
重要的是, 项目列表始终是您现实生活目标和优先事项的最新、及时和准确的反映。特别是因为项目是你的第二大脑的中心组织原则。当您准备好并等待一个项目文件夹时, 您的头脑就会注意到并捕捉最好的想法来推动它向前发展。

3. **Review my areas of responsibility.** Now it’s time to do the same for my areas of responsibility. I’ll think about the major areas of my life, such as my health, finances, relationships, and home life, and decide if there’s anything I want to change or take action on. This reflection often generates new action items (which go into my task manager) and new notes (which get captured in my notes app).  
3. 审查我的职责范围。现在是时候对我负责的领域做同样的事情了。我会考虑我生活中的主要领域, 例如我的健康、财务、人际关系和家庭生活, 并决定是否有任何我想改变或采取行动的地方。这种反思通常会生成新的操作项 (进入我的任务管理器) 和新的笔记(在我的笔记应用程序中捕获)。

Area notebooks often contain notes that become the seeds of future projects. For example, I used an area folder called “Home” to collect photos for the home studio remodel I mentioned previously. Even before it was an active project, that broader area gave me a place to collect ideas and inspiration so it was ready and waiting the moment we decided to get started.  
区域笔记本通常包含成为未来项目种子的笔记。例如, 我使用一个名为 “Home” 的区域文件夹来收集我之前提到的家庭工作室改造的照片。甚至在它成为一个活跃的项目之前, 那个更广阔的区域给了我一个收集想法和灵感的地方, 所以它已经准备好了, 等待我们决定开始的那一刻。

4. **Review someday/maybe tasks.** “Someday/maybe” is a special category for things I’d like to get to someday, but not in the near future. Things like “Learn Mandarin” and “Plant an orchard.” These kinds of future dreams are important to keep track of, but you don’t want them cluttering your priorities today. I’ll take a few minutes to go through my “someday/maybe” tasks just in case any of them have become actionable. For example, when my wife and I settled down and became homeowners, our dream of getting a dog, which was impossible while moving from one apartment to another, suddenly came within reach. I had already saved a few notes on the kinds of dogs we should consider (athletic, hypoallergenic, good with kids, etc.), and this step in my Monthly Review reminded me to bring them to the surface.  
4. 回顾某天 / 也许的任务。 “某天 / 也许”是一个特殊的类别, 用于表示我希望某天 (但不是在不久的将来) 完成的事情。诸如 “学习普通话” 和“种植果园”之类的东西。跟踪这些未来的梦想很重要, 但你不希望它们扰乱你今天的优先事项。我将花几分钟时间完成我的 “某天 / 也许” 任务, 以防万一它们中的任何一个变成了 actionable。例如, 当我和我的妻子安顿下来并成为房主时, 我们养狗的梦想突然变得触手可及, 这在从一间公寓搬到另一间公寓时是不可能的。我已经保存了一些关于我们应该考虑的狗种类的笔记(运动型、低过敏性、适合孩子等), 我每月回顾中的这一步提醒我把它们带到表面。

5. **Reprioritize tasks.** Finally, once I’ve completed all the previous steps and have a holistic picture of my goals and projects in mind, it’s time to reprioritize my tasks. I’m often surprised just how much can change in a month. To-dos that seemed critical last month might become irrelevant this month, and vice versa.  
5. 重新确定任务的优先级。最后, 一旦我完成了前面的所有步骤并对我的目标和项目有了一个全面的了解, 就该重新确定我的任务的优先级了。我常常惊讶于一个月内可以改变多少。上个月看起来很重要的待办事项本月可能变得无关紧要, 反之亦然。

### The Noticing Habits: Using Your Second Brain to Engineer Luck  
注意习惯: 用你的第二大脑来设计运气

There’s a third category of habits that will come in handy as you start putting your Second Brain into action in the real world. It is in some ways the most important category, but also the least predictable.  
当你开始在现实世界中将你的第二大脑付诸行动时, 第三类习惯会派上用场。它在某些方面是最重要的类别, 但也是最不可预测的。

I call them “noticing” habits—taking advantage of small opportunities you notice to capture something you might otherwise skip over or to make a note more actionable or discoverable. Here are some examples:  
我称它们为 “注意” 习惯——利用你注意到的小机会来捕捉你可能会跳过的东西, 或者使笔记更易于操作或更容易被发现。这里有些例子:

*   Noticing that an idea you have in mind could potentially be valuable and capturing it instead of thinking, “Oh, it’s nothing.”  
    注意到你脑海中的一个想法可能是有价值的, 并抓住它而不是想,“哦, 这没什么。”
*   Noticing when an idea you’re reading about resonates with you and taking those extra few seconds to highlight it.  
    注意你正在阅读的想法何时与你产生共鸣, 并多花几秒钟来强调它。
*   Noticing that a note could use a better title—and changing it so it’s easier for your future self to find it.  
    注意到笔记可以使用更好的标题 - 并更改它以便未来的自己更容易找到它。
*   Noticing you could move or link a note to another project or area where it will be more useful.  
    注意你可以将笔记移动或链接到另一个项目或区域, 在那里它会更有用。
*   Noticing opportunities to combine two or more Intermediate Packets into a new, larger work so you don’t have to start it from scratch.  
    注意到将两个或多个中间包组合成一个新的、更大的作品的机会, 这样你就不必从头开始。
*   Noticing a chance to merge similar content from different notes into the same note so it’s not spread around too many places.  
    注意有机会将来自不同笔记的相似内容合并到同一个笔记中, 这样它就不会散布在太多地方。
*   Noticing when an IP that you already have could help someone else solve a problem, and sharing it with them, even if it’s not perfect.  
    注意您已经拥有的 IP 何时可以帮助其他人解决问题, 并与他们分享, 即使它并不完美。

The nice thing about notes, unlike to-dos, is that they aren’t urgent. If one important to-do gets overlooked, the results could be catastrophic. Notes, on the other hand, can easily be put on hold any time you get busy, without any negative impact. If you have the time to organize your notes each week, that’s great. If you don’t, it’s no problem. I often will wait weeks or even a month or longer before I find the time to clear my notes inbox. They remain ready and waiting there for as long as I need.  
与待办事项不同, 笔记的好处在于它们并不紧急。如果忽略了一项重要的任务, 结果可能是灾难性的。另一方面, 您可以在忙碌的任何时候轻松地搁置笔记, 而不会产生任何负面影响。如果您每周都有时间整理笔记, 那就太好了。如果你不这样做, 那没问题。我经常要等几周甚至一个月或更长时间才能找到时间清理我的笔记收件箱。只要我需要, 他们就会随时待命。

The most common misconception about organizing I see when I’m working with clients is the belief that organizing requires a heavy lift. They seem to believe that if they could just block off their calendar and get a few days free of pressing commitments, then they’d finally be able to curb the clutter and clear their head.  
当我与客户合作时, 我看到的关于组织的最常见误解是认为组织需要举重。他们似乎相信, 如果他们能把日程安排好, 腾出几天时间来处理紧迫的事情, 那么他们最终就能摆脱混乱, 理清头绪。

Even on the rare occasions I’ve seen people somehow manage to clear such a big block of time, it never seems to go very well. They tend to get bogged down in minutiae and barely make a dent in the mountain of accumulated stuff they wanted to tackle. Then they’re saddled with a feeling of guilt that they weren’t able to make progress even with so much time at their disposal. It’s not natural for humans to completely reorganize their entire world all at once. There are too many layers, too many facets of a human life, to perfectly square every little detail.  
即使在极少数情况下, 我也见过人们以某种​​方式设法清理这么长的时间, 但似乎从来都不会很顺利。他们往往陷入细枝末节的泥潭, 而几乎没有在他们想要解决的堆积如山的问题上有所作为。然后他们会感到内疚, 因为即使有那么多时间可以支配, 他们也无法取得进步。人类一下子完全重组整个世界是不自然的。 太多层, 人类生活的太多方面, 无法完美地处理每一个小细节。

It’s crucial to stay organized, but it needs to be done a little at a time in the flow of our normal lives. It needs to be done in the in-between moments of moving your projects forward as you notice small opportunities for improvement.  
保持井井有条是至关重要的, 但在我们的正常生活中需要一次完成一点。它需要在项目向前推进的中间时刻完成, 因为您注意到很小的改进机会。

Here are more specific examples of what those opportunities might look like:  
以下是这些机会的更具体示例:

*   You decide to visit Costa Rica on your next vacation, so you move a note with useful Spanish phrases from your “Languages” resource folder to a “Costa Rica” project folder to aid in your trip.  
    您决定在下一个假期访问哥斯达黎加, 因此您将带有有用西班牙语短语的注释从 “语言” 资源文件夹移动到 “哥斯达黎加” 项目文件夹以帮助您的旅行。
*   Your director of engineering leaves for another job and you need to hire a new one, so you move the folder you created last time for “Engineering hire” from archives to projects to guide your search.  
    您的工程主管去另一份工作, 而您需要雇用新的, 因此您将上次为 “工程雇用” 创建的文件夹从档案移动到项目以指导您的搜索。
*   You schedule the next in a series of workshops you are facilitating and move a PDF with workshop exercises from an area folder called “Workshops” to a new project folder for the specific workshop you’re planning.  
    您在您正在促进的一系列研讨会中安排下一个, 并将带有研讨会练习的 PDF 从名为 “Workshops” 的区域文件夹移动到您正在计划的特定研讨会的新项目文件夹。
*   You notice that you need to buy a new computer because your current one is getting too slow, so you move some articles you’ve saved from the “Computer research” resource folder to a new project folder called “Buy a new computer.”  
    您注意到您需要购买一台新计算机, 因为您当前的计算机速度太慢, 因此您将保存的一些文章从 “计算机研究” 资源文件夹移动到一个名为 “购买新计算机” 的新项目文件夹中。

All these actions take mere moments, and are made in response to changes in your priorities and goals. We should avoid doing a lot of heavy lifting up front, not only because it takes up precious time and energy, but because it locks us into a course of action that might not end up being right.  
所有这些行动只需片刻, 是为了响应您的优先事项和目标的变化而做出的。我们应该避免预先做很多繁重的工作, 不仅因为这会占用宝贵的时间和精力, 而且因为它会将我们锁定在一个最终可能不正确的行动过程中。

When you make your digital notes a _working_ environment, not just a storage environment, you end up spending a lot more time there. When you spend more time there, you’ll inevitably notice many more small opportunities for change than you expect. Over time, this will gradually produce an environment far more suited to your real needs than anything you could have planned up front. Just like professional chefs keep their environment organized with small nudges and adjustments, you can use noticing habits to “organize as you go.”  
当你把你的数字笔记变成一个工作环境, 而不仅仅是一个存储环境时, 你最终会花更多的时间在那里。当你花更多时间在那里时, 你不可避免地会注意到比你预期更多的小改变机会。随着时间的推移, 这将逐渐产生一个比您预先计划的任何环境都更适合您实际需求的环境。就像专业厨师通过微调和调整来保持环境井井有条一样, 您可以养成注意的习惯来 “边走边整理”。

### Your Turn: A Perfect System You Don’t Use Isn’t Perfect  
轮到你了: 你不使用的完美系统并不完美

Each of the three kinds of habits I’ve introduced you to—Project Kickoff and Completion Checklists, Weekly and Monthly Reviews, and Noticing Habits—are all meant to be performed quickly in the in-between spaces of your day.  
我向您介绍的三种习惯中的每一种——项目启动和完成清单、每周和每月回顾, 以及注意习惯——都应该在一天的间隙中快速养成。

They are designed to build on activities you are probably already doing in some form, adding perhaps a little bit more structure. These shouldn’t be massive feats, requiring you to set aside huge chunks of time in total Zen-like isolation. That’s not realistic, and if you wait until those perfect conditions arrive, you’ll never take even the first step.  
它们旨在建立在您可能已经以某种形式进行的活动的基础上, 并可能添加更多结构。这些不应该是巨大的壮举, 需要你在完全禅宗般的孤立中留出大量时间。这是不现实的, 如果你等到那些完美的条件到来, 你甚至都不会迈出第一步。

The checklists I’ve provided are a starting point to help you add some predictability in an environment that is often chaotic and unpredictable. They provide a regular cadence of actions for taking in, processing, and making use of digital information, without requiring you to stop everything and reorganize everything all at once.  
我提供的清单是一个起点, 可帮助您在通常混乱且不可预测的环境中增加一些可预测性。它们为接收、处理和使用数字信息提供了固定的行动节奏, 而不需要您立即停止一切并重新组织一切。

I want to remind you that the maintenance of your Second Brain is very forgiving. Unlike a car engine, nothing will explode, break down, or burst into flames if you let things slide for days, weeks, or even months. The entire point of building a Second Brain and pouring your thoughts into it is to make those thoughts less vulnerable to the passage of time. They will be ready to pick up right where you left off when you have more time or motivation.  
我想提醒你, 你的第二大脑的维护是非常宽容的。与汽车发动机不同, 如果让物体滑动数天、数周或 甚至数月, 任何东西都不会爆炸、分解或起火。构建第二大脑并将你的想法倾注其中的全部意义在于让这些想法不那么容易受到时间流逝的影响。当您有更多时间或动力时, 他们将准备好从您停下的地方继续。

To make this concrete: 为了使这个具体:

*   There’s no need to capture every idea; the best ones will always come back around eventually.  
    没有必要捕捉每一个想法; 最好的最终总会回来。
*   There’s no need to clear your inbox frequently; unlike your to-do list, there’s no negative consequence if you miss a given note.  
    无需经常清理收件箱; 与你的待办事项列表不同, 如果你错过了给定的笔记, 不会有任何负面影响。
*   There’s no need to review or summarize notes on a strict timeline; we’re not trying to memorize their contents or keep them top of mind.  
    无需在严格的时间表上复习或总结笔记; 我们并不是要记住它们的内容或将它们放在首位。
*   When organizing notes or files within PARA, it’s a very forgiving decision of where to put something, since search is so effective as a backup option.  
    在 PARA 中组织笔记或文件时, 把东西放在哪里是一个非常宽容的决定, 因为搜索作为备份选项非常有效。

The truth is, any system that must be perfect to be reliable is deeply flawed. A perfect system you don’t use because it’s too complicated and error prone isn’t a perfect system—it’s a fragile system that will fall apart as soon as you turn your attention elsewhere.  
事实是, 任何必须完美才能可靠的系统都存在严重缺陷。一个你因为太复杂和容易出错而不使用的完美系统并不是一个完美的系统——它是一个脆弱的系统, 一旦你将注意力转移到别处就会崩溃。

We have to remember that we are not building an encyclopedia of immaculately organized knowledge. We are building a _working system_. Both in the sense that it must work, and in the sense that it is a regular part of our everyday lives. For that reason, you should prefer a system that is imperfect, but that continues to be useful in the real conditions of your life.  
我们必须记住, 我们并不是在建立一个组织严密的知识百科全书。我们正在建立一个工作系统。从它必须起作用的意义上说, 从它是我们日常生活的常规部分的意义上说。出于这个原因, 你应该更喜欢一个不完美的系统, 但它在你生活的真实条件下仍然有用。

1.  [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-004-backlink). A premortem is a useful practice, similar to a postmortem used to analyze how a project went wrong, except performed _before_ the project starts. By asking what is likely to go wrong, you can take action to prevent it from happening in the first place.  
    我 。事前剖析是一种有用的做法, 类似于用于分析项目如何出错的事后剖析, 只是在项目开始之前进行。通过询问可能会出现什么问题, 您可以采取措施在第一时间防止它发生。

    三、这本书 Getting Things Done, 被称为 GTD, 是个人知识管理的一个有用的对应物, 它应用了我们用于注释 “可操作” 信息 (如待办事项) 的相同镜头“让事情从你的脑海中消失”。

For most of history, humanity’s challenge was how to acquire scarce information. There was hardly any good information to be found anywhere. It was locked up in difficult-to-reproduce manuscripts or stuck in the heads of scholars. Access to information was limited, but that wasn’t a problem for most people. Their lives and livelihoods didn’t require much information. Their main contribution was their physical labor, not their ideas.  
在历史的大部分时间里, 人类面临的挑战是如何获取稀缺信息。到处都找不到任何好的信息。它被锁在难以复制的手稿中或卡在学者的脑海中。获取信息的机会有限, 但这对大多数人来说不是问题。他们的生活和生计不需要太多信息。他们的主要贡献是他们的体力劳动, 而不是他们的想法。

That has all changed in just the last few decades. Historically, in the blink of an eye. Suddenly, we are all plugged into an infinite stream of data, updated continuously and delivered at light speed via a network of intelligent devices embedded in every corner of our lives.  
在过去的几十年里, 这一切都发生了变化。历史, 眨眼之间。突然间, 我们都被插入了无限的数据流中, 通过嵌入我们生活各个角落的智能设备网络不断更新并以光速传输。

Not only that, but the very nature of labor has changed. Value has shifted from the output of our muscles to the output of our brains. Our knowledge is now our most important asset and the ability to deploy our attention our most valuable skill. The tools of our trade have become abstract and immaterial: the building blocks of ideas, insights, facts, frameworks, and mental models.  
不仅如此, 劳动的本质也发生了变化。价值已经从我们肌肉的输出转移到我们大脑的输出。现在, 我们的知识是我们最重要的资产, 而集中注意力的能力是我们最宝贵的技能。我们交易的工具 已经变得抽象和非物质: 思想、见解、事实、框架和心智模型的基石。

Now our challenge isn’t to acquire more information; as we saw in the exploration of divergence and convergence, it is to find ways to close off the stream so we can get something done. Any change in how we interact with information first requires a change in how we think. In this chapter we’ll explore what it looks like and feels like to make that shift.  
现在我们的挑战不是获取更多信息, 而是获取更多信息。正如我们在发散和趋同的探索中看到的那样, 就是找到关闭流的方法, 这样我们才能完成一些事情。我们与信息互动方式的任何改变首先需要我们思考方式的改变。在本章中, 我们将探索做出这种转变的样子和感觉。

### Mindset Over Toolset—The Quest for the Perfect App  
Mindset Over Toolset——追求完美的应用程序

The majority of this book has been about acquiring a new set of tools in your relationship to information. However, over the years I’ve noticed that it is never a person’s toolset that constrains their potential, it’s their mindset.  
本书的大部分内容都是关于在您与信息的关系中获得一套新工具的。然而, 多年来我注意到, 限制一个人潜力的从来不是工具, 而是他们的心态。

You might have arrived at this book because you heard about this new field called personal knowledge management, or maybe when you were trying to find guidance in how to use a cool new notetaking app. Maybe you were drawn in by the promise of new techniques for enhancing your productivity, or perhaps it was the allure of a systematic approach to creativity.  
你可能是因为听说过这个叫做个人知识管理的新领域, 或者当你试图寻找如何使用一个很酷的新笔记应用程序的指导时才读到这本书的。也许您是被提高生产力的新技术的承诺所吸引, 或者也许是系统化的创造力方法所具有的吸引力。

Whatever you are looking for, all these paths eventually lead to the same place, if you are willing to follow: a journey of personal growth. There is no divide between our inner selves and our digital lives: the beliefs and attitudes that shape our thinking in one context inevitably show up in other contexts as well.  
无论您在寻找什么, 如果您愿意追随, 所有这些路径最终都会通向同一个地方: 个人成长之旅。我们的内在自我和我们的数字生活之间没有界限: 在一种情况下塑造我们思维的信念和态度也不可避免地会出现在其他情况下。

Underlying our struggles and challenges with productivity, creativity, and performance is our fundamental relationship to the information in our lives. That relationship was forged during your upbringing as you encountered new experiences, and was influenced by your personality, learning style, relationships, and your genes. You learned to react in a certain way when faced with new ideas. You adopted a default “blueprint” for how you treated incoming information—with anticipation, fear, excitement, self-doubt, or some complex mix of feelings that is unique to you.  
我们在生产力、创造力和绩效方面的斗争和挑战背后是我们与生活中信息的基本关系。这种关系是在你成长过程中遇到新的经历时建立起来的, 并受到 你的个性、学习方式、人际关系和你的基因的影响。你学会了在面对新想法时以某种方式做出反应。你采用了一个默认的 “蓝图” 来处理你如何处理收到的信息——带着期待、恐惧、兴奋、自我怀疑, 或者一些你独有的复杂感觉。

That default attitude to information colors every aspect of your life. It is the lens through which you studied for classes and took tests in school. It set the stage for the kinds of jobs and careers you pursued. At this very moment, as you read these words, that default attitude is working in the background. It is telling you what to think about what you’re reading—how to interpret it, how to feel about it, and how it applies to you.  
这种对信息的默认态度影响着你生活的方方面面。它是您学习课程和在学校参加考试的镜头。它为您从事的各种工作和职业奠定了基础。就在这一刻, 当你读到这些文字时, 那种默认的态度正在背后发挥作用。它告诉你如何看待你正在阅读的内容——如何解释它, 如何感受它, 以及它如何适用于你。

Our attitude toward information profoundly shapes how we see and understand the world and our place in it. Our success in the workforce depends on our ability to make use of information more effectively and to think better, smarter, faster. As society gets ever more complex, this emphasis on personal intelligence is only increasing. The quality of our thinking has become one of the central defining features of our identity, our reputation, and our quality of life. We are constantly advised that we need to know more to be able to achieve our goals and dreams.  
我们对信息的态度深刻地塑造了我们如何看待和理解世界以及我们在其中的位置。我们在职场上的成功取决于我们更有效地利用信息以及更好、更聪明、更快地思考的能力。随着社会变得越来越复杂, 对个人智慧的重视程度只会越来越高。我们的思维质量已成为我们身份、声誉和生活质量的核心定义特征之一。我们不断被告知, 我们需要了解更多才能实现我们的目标和梦想。

What would you say if I told you that isn’t true?  
如果我告诉你那不是真的, 你会怎么说?

### The Fear Our Minds Can’t Do Enough  
害怕我们的思想做不够

When it comes to accomplishing our goals, it’s not that innate intelligence isn’t valuable. I’m saying that the greater the burden you place on your biological brain to give you everything you want and need, the more it will struggle under the weight of it all. You’ll feel more stressed, anxious, like there are way too many balls in the air. The more time your brain spends striving to achieve and overcome and solve problems, the less time you have left over for imagining, creating, and simply enjoying the life you’re living. The brain can solve problems, but that isn’t its sole purpose. Your mind was meant for much more.  
当谈到实现我们的目标时, 并不是说先天的智慧没有价值。我是说, 为了给你想要和需要的一切, 你给你的生物大脑施加的负担越大, 它就越会在这一切的重压下挣扎。你会感到压力更大、更焦虑, 就像空气中有太多的球一样。你的大脑花在努力实现和克服以及 解决问题上的时间越多, 你留给想象、创造和享受你现在生活的时间就越少。大脑可以解决问题, 但这不是它的唯一目的。你的思想意味着更多。

It is this fundamental attitude toward information that will start to change as you integrate your Second Brain into your life. You will begin to see connections you didn’t know you could make. Ideas about business, psychology, and technology will connect and spawn new revelations you’ve never consciously considered. Lessons from art, philosophy, and history will intermingle to give you epiphanies about how the world works. You will naturally start to combine these ideas to form new perspectives, new theories, and new strategies. You will be filled with a sense of awe at the elegance of the system you’ve created, and how it works in almost mysterious ways to bring to your attention the information you need.  
当您将第二大脑融入您的生活时, 这种对信息的基本态度将开始发生变化。您将开始看到您不知道可以建立的联系。关于商业、心理学和技术的想法将联系起来并产生你从未有意识地考虑过的新启示。艺术、哲学和历史的教训将交织在一起, 让你顿悟世界是如何运作的。你会很自然地开始将这些想法结合起来, 形成新的视角、新的理论和新的策略。您将惊叹于您所创建的系统的优雅, 以及它如何以近乎神秘的方式工作以引起您的注意您需要的信息。

Maybe you don’t see yourself as a writer, creator, or expert. I certainly didn’t when I first started taking notes on my health problems. Once you start seeing even your biggest ambitions in terms of the smaller chunks of information they are made up of, you’ll begin to realize that any experience or passing insight can be valuable. Your fears, doubts, mistakes, missteps, failures, and self-criticism—it’s all just information to be taken in, processed, and made sense of. All of it is part of a larger, ever-evolving whole.  
也许您不认为自己是作家、创作者或专家。当我第一次开始记录我的健康问题时, 我当然没有。一旦你开始从组成小块信息的角度看待你最大的抱负, 你就会开始意识到任何经验或短暂的洞察力都是有价值的。你的恐惧、怀疑、错误、失误、失败和自我批评——这些都只是需要接受、处理和理解的信息。所有这些都是一个更大的、不断发展的整体的一部分。

A participant in one of my courses named Amelia recently told me that starting to build her Second Brain had caused her to make a 180-degree change in her relationship to the Internet. She had seen it as “sensationalistic and offensive” and, as a result, hadn’t wanted to engage with the online world at all. Once she had a place where she could curate the best of the Internet while ignoring everything that didn’t serve her, she told me she began to see it in a completely new light. Amelia is a skilled leadership coach who runs a clinic teaching leaders how to manage their nervous systems to improve their well-being and effectiveness. Imagine how many more people she can reach with her expertise now that she sees the Internet as a source of wisdom and connection, not just noise.  
我的一门课程的参与者 Amelia 最近告诉我, 开始构建她的第二大脑使她与互联网的关系发生了 180 度的转变。她认为这是 “煽情和冒犯性的”, 因此根本不想参与网络世界。一旦她有了一个地方, 在那里她可以挑选最好的互联网, 同时忽略一切对她不利的东西, 她告诉我她开始以全新的眼光看待它。 Amelia 是一位技术娴熟的领导力教练, 她经营一家诊所, 教授 leaders 如何管理他们的神经系统以提高他们的幸福感和效率。想象一下, 既然她将互联网视为智慧和联系的源泉, 而不仅仅是噪音, 她可以用她的专业知识接触到更多的人。

How does such a dramatic change happen? Amelia didn’t necessarily learn a new fact that she didn’t know before. She took on a new perspective. She chose to look at the world through a different lens—the lens of appreciation and abundance. We can’t always control what happens to us, but we can choose the lens we look through. This is the basic choice we have in creating our own experience—which aspects to nourish or starve, using only the magnifying power of our attention.  
如此戏剧性的变化是如何发生的? 阿米莉亚不一定了解她以前不知道的新事实。她采用了新的视角。她选择通过一个不同的镜头——欣赏和丰富的镜头来看待这个世界。我们不能总是控制发生在我们身上的事情, 但我们可以选择我们看的镜头。这是我们在创造自己的体验时所拥有的基本选择——滋养或饥饿哪些方面, 只使用我们注意力的放大力量。

As you build a Second Brain, your biological brain will inevitably change. It will start to adapt to the presence of this new technological appendage, treating it as an extension of itself. Your mind will become calmer, knowing that every idea is being tracked. It will become more focused, knowing it can put thoughts on hold and access them later. I often hear that people start to feel a tremendous sense of conviction—for their goals, their dreams, and the things they want to change or influence in the world—because they know they have a powerful system behind them amplifying every move they make.  
当你建立第二大脑时, 你的生物大脑将不可避免地发生变化。它将开始适应这种新技术附属物的存在, 将其视为自身的延伸。你的头脑会变得更加平静, 因为你知道每个想法都在被追踪。它会变得更加专注, 知道它可以搁置想法并在以后访问它们。我经常听到人们开始对他们的目标、梦想以及他们想要改变或影响世界的事物产生强烈的信念感, 因为他们知道他们背后有一个强大的系统在放大他们所做的每一个动作。

### Giving Your First Brain a New Job  
给你的第一个大脑一份新工作

Instead of trying to optimize your mind so that it can manage every tiny detail of your life, it’s time to fire your biological brain from that job and give it a new one: as the CEO of your life, orchestrating and managing the process of turning information into results. We’re asking your biological brain to hand over the job of remembering to an external system, and by doing so, freeing it to absorb and integrate new knowledge in more creative ways.  
与其试图优化你的大脑, 让它可以管理你生活中的每一个微小细节, 不如让你的生物大脑从那份工作中解脱出来, 给它一个新的工作: 作为你生活的首席执行官, 协调和管理转变的过程信息转化为结果。我们要求你的生物大脑将记忆的工作移交给外部系统, 并通过这样做, 释放它以更具创造性的方式吸收和整合新知识。

Your Second Brain is always on, has perfect memory, and can scale to any size. The more you outsource and delegate the jobs of capturing, organizing, and distilling to technology, the more time and energy you’ll have available for the self-expression that only you can do.  
你的第二大脑始终处于开启状态, 具有完美的记忆力, 并且可以扩展到任何大小。您将捕获、组织和提炼的工作外包和委派给技术的次数越多, 您就会有更多的时间和精力用于只有您才能做到的自我表达。

Once your biology is no longer the bottleneck on your potential, you’ll be free to expand the flow of information as much as you want without drowning in it. You’ll be more balanced and peaceful, knowing you can step away from that flow at any time because it’s all being stored safely outside your head. You will be more trusting, because you’ve learned to trust a system outside yourself. It will be incredibly humbling and reassuring, in fact, that you are not solely responsible for all the remembering that needs to happen in your life. You will be more open-minded, willing to consider more unorthodox, more challenging, more unfinished ideas, because you have a plentiful supply of alternatives to choose from. You’ll want to expose yourself to more diverse perspectives, from more people, without necessarily committing to any single one. You’ll become a curator of perspectives, free to pick and choose the beliefs and concepts that serve you best in any given situation.  
一旦你的生物学不再是你潜力的瓶颈, 你就可以随心所欲地扩展信息流, 而不会淹没其中。你会更加平衡和平静, 因为你知道你可以随时远离这种流动, 因为它都安全地储存在你的头脑之外。你会更加信任他人, 因为你已经学会信任自己之外的系统。事实上, 这将令人难以置信地感到谦卑和安心, 因为您不应该独自对生活中需要发生的所有记忆负责。你的思想会更加开放, 愿意考虑更多非正统的、更具挑战性的、更多未完成的想法, 因为你有大量可供选择的选择。你会想要让自己接触更多不同的人的不同观点, 而不必只关注任何一个。您将成为观点的策展人, 可以自由挑选在任何给定情况下最适合您的信念和概念。

Delegating a job you’ve been doing for a long time is always intimidating. The voice of fear creeps up in the back of your mind: “Will there be anything left for me to do?” “Will I still be valued and needed?” We are taught that it’s better to have a secure role than risk being replaced. That it’s safer to keep your head down and not make a fuss rather than strive for something better. Emptying ourselves of our jumble of thoughts requires courage, because without our thoughts as distractions, we are left to sit with uncomfortable questions about our future and our purpose.  
委派一项你已经做了很长时间的工作总是令人生畏。恐惧的声音在你的脑海深处悄悄升起:“我还有什么可做的吗?” “我还会被重视和需要吗?” 我们被告知, 拥有一个安全的角色比冒着被替换的风险更好。保持低调而不是大惊小怪比争取更好的事情更安全。清空我们自己的杂念需要勇气, 因为如果没有我们的思想让我们分心, 我们就会坐下来思考关于我们的未来和我们的目标的令人不安的问题。

That is why building a Second Brain is a journey of personal growth. As your information environment changes, the way your mind operates starts to be transformed. You leave behind one identity and step into another—an identity as the orchestrator and conductor of your life, not its passenger. Any shift in identity can feel confronting and scary. You don’t know exactly who you will be and what it will be like on the other side, but if you persevere through the transition, there is always a new horizon of hope, possibility, and freedom waiting for you on the other side.  
这就是为什么打造第二大脑是个人成长的旅程。随着您的信息环境发生变化, 您的 mind 运作方式开始转变。你离开一个身份, 进入另一个身份——一个作为你生活的协调者和指挥者的身份, 而不是它的乘客。身份的任何转变都会让人感到对抗和恐惧。你不确切地知道你会成为什么样的人以及另一边会是什么样子, 但如果你坚持过渡, 那么在另一边总会有一个新的希望、可能性和自由的地平线在等着你。

How do you know when you’ve begun making the shift to this new identity I’ve described? The biggest shift that starts to occur as soon as you start creating a Second Brain is the shift from viewing the world through the lens of scarcity to seeing it through the lens of abundance.  
你怎么知道你什么时候开始转变为我所描述的这个新身份? 一旦你开始创造第二大脑, 最大的转变就是从稀缺的角度看世界到丰富的角度看世界。

I see so many people trying to operate in this new world under the assumptions of the past—that information is scarce, and therefore we need to acquire and consume and hoard as much of it as possible. We’ve been conditioned to view information through a consumerist lens: that more is better, without limit. Through the lens of scarcity, we constantly crave more, more, more information, a response to the fear of not having enough.[1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch10fn1) We’ve been taught that information must be jealously guarded, because someone could use it against us or steal our ideas. That our value and self-worth come from what we know and can recite on command.  
我看到很多人在过去的假设下试图在这个新世界中运作——信息是稀缺的, 因此我们需要尽可能多地获取、消费和囤积信息。我们已经习惯于通过消费主义的视角来看待信息: 越多越好, 没有限制。通过稀缺的镜头, 我们不断渴望更多、更多、更多的信息, 以回应对信息不足的恐惧。 [1](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#ch10fn1) 我们被教导必须小心翼翼地保护信息, 因为有人可能会利用它来对付我们或窃取我们的想法。我们的价值和自我价值来自于我们所知道的并且可以根据命令背诵。

As we saw in the chapter on Capturing, the inclination to amass information can become an end in itself. It is all too easy to default to collecting more and more content without regard to whether it is useful or beneficial to us. This is indiscriminate consumption of information, treating every meme and random post on social media as if it was just as important as the most profound piece of wisdom. It is driven by fear—the fear of missing out on some crucial fact, idea, or story that everyone is talking about. The paradox of hoarding is that no matter how much we collect and accumulate, it’s never enough. The lens of scarcity also tells us that the information we already have must not be very valuable, compelling us to keep searching externally for what’s missing inside.  
正如我们在捕获一章中看到的那样, 收集信息的倾向本身可能成为目的。很容易默认收集越来越多的内容, 而不考虑它是否对我们有用或有益。这是不分青红皂白地消费信息, 将社交媒体上的每一个表情包和随机帖子都视为与最深刻的智慧一样重要。它是由恐惧驱动的——害怕错过每个人都在谈论的一些关键事实、想法或 故事。囤积的悖论是, 无论我们收集和积累多少, 都永远不够。稀缺的镜头也告诉我们, 我们已经拥有的信息一定不是很有价值, 迫使我们不断从外部寻找内部缺失的东西。

The opposite of a Scarcity Mindset is an Abundance Mindset. This is a way of looking at the world as full of valuable and helpful things—ideas, insights, tools, collaborations, opportunities. An Abundance Mindset tells us that there is an endless amount of incredibly powerful knowledge everywhere we look—in the content we consume, in our social network, in our bodies and intuitions, and in our own minds. It also tells us that we don’t need to consume or understand all of it, or even much of it. All we need is a few seeds of wisdom, and the seeds we most need tend to continually find us again and again. You don’t need to go out and hunt down insights. All you have to do is listen to what life is repeatedly trying to tell you. Life tends to surface exactly what we need to know, whether we like it or not. Like a compassionate but unyielding teacher, reality doesn’t bend or cave to our will. It patiently teaches us in what ways our thinking is not accurate, and those lessons tend to show up across our lives again and again.  
稀缺心态的对立面是丰富心态。这是一种看待世界的方式, 它充满了有价值和有用的东西——想法、见解、工具、合作、机会。丰富的心态告诉我们, 在我们所看到的任何地方——在我们消费的内容中、在我们的社交网络中、在我们的身体和直觉中, 以及在我们自己的头脑中, 都有无穷无尽的令人难以置信的强大知识。它还告诉我们, 我们不需要消费或理解所有这些, 甚至不需要大部分。我们所需要的只是一些智慧的种子, 而我们最需要的种子往往会不断地一次又一次地找到我们。您无需外出寻找见解。你所要做的就是倾听生活反复试图告诉你的事情。生活往往会准确地呈现出我们需要知道的东西, 无论我们喜欢与否。就像一位富有同情心但不屈不挠的老师, 现实不会屈服于我们的意志。它耐心地告诉我们, 我们的思维在哪些方面是不准确的, 这些教训往往会一次又一次地出现在我们的生活中。

Making the shift to a mindset of abundance is about letting go of the things we thought we needed to survive but that no longer serve us. It means giving up low-value work that gives us a false sense of security but that doesn’t call forth our highest selves. It’s about letting go of low-value information that seems important, but that doesn’t make us better people. It’s about putting down the protective shield of fear that tells us we need to protect ourselves from the opinions of others, because that same shield is keeping us from receiving the gifts they want to give us.  
转变为丰富的心态就是放弃我们认为生存所需但不再为我们服务的事物。这意味着放弃低价值的工作, 这些工作会给我们一种虚假的安全感, 但不会唤起我们最高的自我。这是关于放弃看似重要的低价值信息, 但这并不能使我们成为更好的人。这是关于放下恐惧的保护盾, 恐惧告诉我们我们需要保护自己不受他人意见的影响, 因为同样的盾牌阻止我们接受他们想要给我们的礼物。

### The Shift from Obligation to Service  
从义务到服务的转变

There is a second shift that occurs when you begin to use your Second Brain not only for remembering, but for connecting and creating. You will transition from doing things primarily out of obligation or pressure to doing things from a spirit of service.  
当你开始使用你的第二大脑不仅用于记忆, 而且用于连接和创造时, 就会发生第二次转变。您将从主要出于义务或压力而做事转变为出于服务精神而做事。

I believe most people have a natural desire within them to serve others. They want to teach, to mentor, to help, to contribute. The desire to give back is a fundamental part of what makes us human.  
我相信大多数人都有为他人服务的自然愿望。他们想要教导、指导、帮助、贡献。回馈社会的愿望是使我们成为人类的基本组成部分。

I also notice that many people put that desire on hold. They are waiting for a future time when they will have “enough” time, bandwidth, expertise, or resources. That day seems to get continuously postponed as they get new jobs, start new careers, have kids, and simply try to keep up with the demands of life.  
我还注意到许多人搁置了这种愿望。他们正在等待未来的某个时刻, 那时他们将拥有 “足够” 的时间、带宽、专业知识或资源。随着他们找到新工作、开始新的职业、生孩子, 以及只是努力跟上生活的需求, 这一天似乎不断被推迟。

You are under no obligation to help others. Sometimes it’s all you can do to take care of yourself. Still, I’ve noticed time and again a phenomenon that happens as people collect more and more knowledge in their Second Brain. That inner desire to serve slowly comes to the surface. Faced with the evidence of everything they already know, suddenly there’s no longer any reason to wait.  
您没有义务帮助他人。有时, 您所能做的就是照顾好自己。尽管如此, 我还是一次又一次地注意到随着人们在第二大脑中收集越来越多的知识而发生的一种现象。内心的服务欲望慢慢浮出水面。面对他们已知的一切证据, 突然间没有理由再等待了。

The purpose of knowledge is to be shared. What’s the point of knowing something if it doesn’t positively impact anyone, not even yourself? Learning shouldn’t be about hoarding stockpiles of knowledge like gold coins. Knowledge is the only resource that gets better and more valuable the more it multiplies. If I share a new way of thinking about your health, or finances, or business, or spirituality, that knowledge isn’t less valuable to me. It’s more valuable! Now we can speak the same language, coordinate our efforts, and share our progress in applying it. Knowledge becomes more powerful as it spreads.  
知识的目的是为了共享。如果某事对任何人都没有积极影响, 甚至对你自己都没有影响, 那么了解它又有什么意义呢? 学习不应该像金币一样囤积知识。知识是唯一的资源, 随着它的倍增, 它会变得更好、更有价值。如果我分享一种关于你的健康、财务、商业或灵性的新思考方式, 那么这些知识对我来说并没有降低价值。它更有价值! 现在我们可以说同一种语言, 协调我们的努力, 并分享我们在应用它方面的进展。知识在传播时变得更加强大。

There are problems in the world that you are uniquely equipped to solve. Problems in society like poverty, injustice, and crime. Problems in the economy like inequality, educational deficits, and workers’ rights. Problems in organizations like retention, culture, and growth. Problems in the lives of people around you that your product or service or expertise could solve, helping them communicate, learn, or work more effectively. As Ryder Carroll says in _The Bullet Journal Method_, “Your singular perspective may patch some small hole in the vast tattered fabric of humanity.”  
世界上有些问题你是独一无二的, 可以解决。社会问题, 如贫困、不公正和犯罪。经济中的问题, 如不平等、教育赤字和工人权利。组织中的问题, 如保留、文化和成长。您周围人的生活中的问题, 您的产品或服务或专业知识可以解决, 帮助他们更有效地沟通、学习或工作。正如 Ryder Carroll 在 The Bullet Journal Method 中所说,“你独特的视角可能会修补人类庞大破烂结构中的一些小洞。”

There are people who will be reached only if they are reached by you. People who have no other source for the kind of guidance you can provide. People who don’t know where to look for solutions to problems they might not even know they have. You can be that person for them. You can pay forward some of the immense care that has been poured into you by a lifetime of parents, teachers, and mentors. With mere words, you can open doors to unimaginable horizons for the people around you.  
有些人只有在您联系到他们时才能联系到他们。没有其他来源的人可以提供您可以提供的那种指导。不知道去哪里寻找问题的解决方案的人甚至可能不知道自己遇到了问题。你可以成为他们的那个人。你可以回报父母、老师和导师一生倾注的一些巨大关怀。仅仅用一句话, 你就可以为你周围的人打开通向难以想象的视野的大门。

Your Second Brain starts as a system to support you and your goals, but from there it can just as easily be used to support others and their dreams. You have everything you need to give back and be a force for good in the world. It all starts with knowledge, and you have at your disposal an embarrassment of riches.  
你的第二大脑最初是一个支持你和你的目标的系统, 但从那里它也可以很容易地用来支持他人和他们的梦想。你拥有你需要回馈的一切, 成为世界上一股向善的力量。这一切都始于知识, 而你拥有的是财富的尴尬。

The practice of building a Second Brain is more than the sum of capturing facts, theories, and the opinions of others. At its core, it is about cultivating self-awareness and self-knowledge. When you encounter an idea that resonates with you, it is because that idea reflects back to you something that is already within you. Every external idea is like a mirror, surfacing within us the truths and the stories that want to be told.  
建立第二大脑的实践不仅仅是捕捉事实、理论和他人意见的总和。它的核心是培养自我意识和自我知识。当您遇到一个与您产生共鸣的想法时, 那是因为该想法向您反映了您内在的某些东西。每一个 external 想法都像一面镜子, 在我们内心浮现出真相和想要讲述的故事。

In a 1966 book,[I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-001) the British-Hungarian philosopher Michael Polanyi made an observation that has since become known as “Polanyi’s Paradox.” It can be summarized as “We know more than we can say.”  
在 1966 年的一本书中, [I](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-001) 英裔匈牙利哲学家迈克尔 · 波兰尼 (Michael Polanyi) 提出了一个后来被称为 “波兰尼悖论” 的观察结果。可以概括为“我们知道的比我们能说的更多”。

Polanyi observed that there are many tasks we can easily perform as humans that we can’t fully explain. For example, driving a car or recognizing a face. We can try to describe how we do these things, but our explanations always fall far short. That’s because we are relying on _tacit knowledge_, which is impossible to describe in exact detail. We possess that knowledge, but it resides in our subconscious and muscle memory where language cannot reach.  
Polanyi 观察到, 有许多我们作为人类可以轻松执行的任务, 但我们无法完全解释。例如, 驾驶汽车或识别人脸。我们可以尝试描述我们是如何做这些事情的, 但我们的解释总是远远不够。那是因为我们依赖于隐性知识, 这是不可能精确描述的。我们拥有这些知识, 但它存在于我们的潜意识和肌肉记忆中, 语言无法触及。

This problem—known as “self-ignorance”—has been a major roadblock in the development of artificial intelligence and other computer systems. Because we cannot describe how we know what we know, it can’t be programmed into software.  
这个被称为 “自我无知” 的问题一直是人工智能和其他计算机系统发展的主要障碍。因为我们无法描述我们如何知道我们所知道的, 所以它不能被编程到软件中。

The curse of computer scientists is our blessing, because this tacit knowledge represents the final frontier on which humans outperform machines. The jobs and endeavors that rely on tacit knowledge will be the last ones to be automated.  
计算机科学家的诅咒是我们的祝福, 因为这种隐性知识代表了人类超越机器的最终边界。依赖隐性知识的工作和努力将是最后被自动化的。

As you build your Second Brain, you will collect many facts and figures, but they are just a means to an end: discovering the tacit knowledge that lives within you. It’s in there, but you need external hooks to pull it out and into your conscious awareness. If we know more than we can say, then we need a system for continuously offloading the vast wealth of knowledge we’ve gained from real life experience.  
在构建第二大脑时, 您会收集许多事实和数据, 但它们只是达到目的的一种手段: 发现存在于您体内的隐性知识。它就在那里, 但你需要外部的钩子才能把它拉出来并进入你的意识。如果我们知道的比我们能说的多, 那么我们需要一个系统来不断卸载我们从现实生活经验中获得的大量知识。

You know things about how the world works that you can’t fully put into words. You understand human nature at a deep intuitive level. You see patterns and connections in your field that no other machine or human can see. Life has given you a set of experiences that provide you with a unique lens on the world. Through that lens you can perceive truths that can have a profoundly positive impact on you and others.  
你知道世界是如何运作的, 但你无法完全用语言表达。您以深刻的直觉 level 理解人性。您可以在您的领域中看到其他机器或人类无法看到的模式和联系。生活给了你一系列的经历, 让你以独特的视角观察世界。通过这个镜头, 您可以看到可以对您和他人产生深远积极影响的真理。

We are constantly told that we should be true to ourselves and pursue our deepest desires, but what if you don’t know what your goals and desires are? What if you have no idea what your “life purpose” is or should be? Self-direction is impossible without self-knowledge. How can you know what you want if you don’t know who you are?  
我们经常被告知我们应该忠于自己并追求我们最深切的愿望, 但是如果您不知道自己的目标和愿望是什么怎么办? 如果您不知道您的 “人生目标” 是什么或应该是什么怎么办? 没有自我知识, 自我导向是不可能的。如果你不知道自己是谁, 你怎么知道自己想要什么?

The process of knowing yourself can seem mystical, but I see it as eminently practical. It starts with noticing what resonates with you. Noticing what seems to call out to you in the external world and gives you a sense of déjà vu. There is a universe of thoughts and ideas and emotions within you. Over time, you can uncover new layers of yourself and new facets of your identity. You search outside yourself to search within yourself, knowing that everything you find has always been a part of you.  
了解自己的过程看似神秘, 但我认为它非常实用。首先要注意什么能引起你的共鸣。注意外部世界似乎在呼唤你, 让你有一种似曾相识的感觉。你内在有一个思想、想法和情感的宇宙。随着时间的推移, 您可以发现自己的新层次和身份的新方面。你向外寻找, 向内寻找, 知道你发现的一切一直都是你的一部分。

### Our Fundamental Need for Self-Expression  
我们对自我表达的基本需求

In Chapter 1, I told the story of my unexplained medical condition and how it led me to start organizing information digitally.  
在第 1 章中, 我讲述了我无法解释的身体状况以及它如何促使我开始以数字方式组织信息的故事。

There was a period a few years into that journey when I was at my lowest point. I had seemingly exhausted every avenue that modern medicine could offer me. The doctors were suggesting that it must be all in my head because their diagnostics couldn’t find anything wrong. I was in more pain than ever before, waking up with so much tension in my neck that it felt like a vise clutching me by the throat.  
在那段旅程的几年里, 我处于最低点。我似乎已经用尽了现代医学所能提供给我的所有途径。医生们暗示这一定是我脑子里的问题, 因为他们的诊断没有发现任何问题。我比以往任何时候都更痛苦, 醒来时我的脖子非常紧张, 感觉就像一把老虎钳抓住了我的喉咙。

I started withdrawing from my friends and social circles because I was so consumed by the pain I was experiencing. My attention was so focused on the pain in my body that I found it difficult to hold a conversation. I started spending more and more time by myself, on the Internet, where I could communicate and connect without speech. My view of life darkened as I slowly spiraled into depression and despair. It felt for a time like I had no future. How could I date or make friends without being able to speak? What kind of job could I hold down with unpredictable, chronic pain? What kind of future could I look forward to as my symptoms continued to worsen, without any treatment or even diagnosis on the horizon?  
我开始退出我的朋友和社交圈, 因为我被我所经历的痛苦所吞噬。我的注意力集中在我身体的疼痛上, 以至于我发现很难进行对话。我开始花越来越多的时间一个人呆在互联网上, 在那里我可以不用言语就可以交流和联系。当我慢慢陷入沮丧和绝望时, 我对生活的看法变得暗淡了。有一段时间我觉得自己没有未来。我不会说话怎么能约会或交朋友? 忍受着不可预测的慢性疼痛, 我可以从事什么样的工作? 在没有任何治疗甚至诊断的情况下, 我的症状继续恶化, 我可以期待什么样的未来?

It was around this time that I made two discoveries that changed, and saved, my life. The first was meditation and mindfulness. I began to meditate and discovered a whole realm of spirituality and introspection that I never knew existed. I learned, to my astonishment, that I am not my thoughts. That my thoughts were the constant background chatter of my subconscious mind, and that I could choose whether to “believe” what they were telling me. Meditation gave me more relief from my symptoms than anything the doctors could prescribe. My pain became my teacher, showing me what needed my attention.  
大约在这个时候, 我有了两个改变并挽救了我生命的发现。首先是冥想和正念。我开始冥想, 发现了一个我从来不知道存在的灵性和内省的整个领域。令我惊讶的是, 我了解到我不是我的想法。我的想法是我潜意识中持续不断的背景喋喋不休, 我可以选择是否 “相信” 他们告诉我的事情。冥想比医生开的任何处方都更能缓解我的症状。我的痛苦成了我的老师, 告诉我需要注意什么。

As I started having deep, profoundly moving experiences in meditation, I wanted to share what I was learning with others. This led me to my second great discovery: writing in public.[II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-000) I started a blog, and my very first blog post was about my experience at a Vipassana meditation retreat in Northern California. I still had trouble speaking, so writing became my refuge. On my blog, I could share anything I wanted to, in as much detail as I wanted. I was in control, with no limits on my ability to express myself.  
当我开始在冥想中获得深刻而感人的体验时, 我想与他人分享我所学到的东西。这使我有了第二个伟大发现: 公开写作。 [II](https://1paragraph.app/2023-02-06T09%3A26%3A12.191Z#footnote-000) 我开了一个博客, 我的第一篇博文是关于我在北加州内观禅修的经历。我说话还是有困难, 所以写作成了我的避难所。在我的博客上, 我可以分享我 想要的任何内容, 尽可能详细。我处于控制之中, 表达自己的能力不受限制。

I discovered something through that experience: that self-expression is a fundamental human need. Self-expression is as vital to our survival as food or shelter. We must be able to share the stories of our lives—from the small moments of what happened today at school to our grandest theories of what life is about.  
通过那次经历, 我发现了一些东西: 自我表达是人类的基本需求。自我表达对我们的生存与食物或住所一样重要。我们必须能够分享我们的生活故事——从今天在学校发生的小事到我们关于生活的最宏大理论。

### Your Turn: The Courage to Share  
轮到你了: 分享的勇气

I’ve spoken with so many people about their stories, and I’ve noticed time and again how many of them have beautiful, moving, powerful things to share. They have unique experiences that have revealed to them deep wisdom, yet they almost always undervalue those stories and experiences. They think maybe one day they’ll get around to sharing them. I’m here to tell you that there is no reason to wait. The world is desperate to hear what you know. You can change lives by sharing yourself with others.  
我和很多人谈过他们的故事, 我一次又一次地注意到他们中有多少人有美丽、感人、强大的东西可以分享。他们拥有独特的经历, 这些经历向他们揭示了深刻的智慧, 但他们几乎总是低估这些故事和经历。他们认为也许有一天他们会抽空分享它们。我在这里告诉你, 没有理由等待。世界渴望听到你所知道的。您可以通过与他人分享自己来改变生活。

It takes courage and vulnerability to stand up and deliver your message. It takes going against the grain, refusing to be quiet and hidden in the face of fear. Finding your voice and speaking your truth is a radical act of self-worth: Who are you to speak up? Who says you have anything to offer? Who are you to demand people’s attention and take up their time?  
站起来传递信息需要勇气和脆弱。它需要反其道而行之, 拒绝在恐惧面前保持安静和隐藏。找到你的声音并说出你的真相是一种自我价值的激进行为: 你是谁? 谁说你有什么可以提供的? 你是谁来引起人们的注意并占用他们的时间?

The only way to discover the answer to these questions is by speaking and seeing what comes out. Some of what you say might not resonate with others or provide value to them, but occasionally, you will strike on something—a way of seeing, a perspective, a story—that blows people’s minds and visibly transforms how they see the world. It could be someone you’re having coffee with, a client or customer, or your online followers. In those moments, the vast chasm that separates us as humans is bridged. For a brief moment, you get to feel in your bones that we are all in this together. We are all part of a vast tattered fabric of humanity, and your highest calling is simply to play your part in it.  
要找到这些问题的答案, 唯一的方法就是通过演讲和观察结果。您所说的某些内容可能不会引起其他人的共鸣或为他们提供价值, 但偶尔, 您会触及一些东西——一种看待事物的方式、一种观点、一个故事——这会打动人们的思想并明显地改变他们看待世界的方式。它可能是与您一起喝咖啡的人、客户或客户、 或您的在线粉丝。在那一刻, 将我们作为人类分开的巨大鸿沟被弥合了。有那么一瞬间, 你会从骨子里感觉到我们都在一起。我们都是人类庞大破烂结构的一部分, 您的最高使命就是在其中发挥自己的作用。

With the power of a Second Brain behind you, you can do and be anything you want. Everything is just information, and you are a master at flowing and shaping it toward whatever future you desire.  
有了第二大脑的支持, 你可以做任何你想做的事。一切都只是信息, 而你是流动和塑造它向你想要的任何未来发展的大师。

### Final Thoughts: You Can Do This  
最后的想法: 你可以做到这一点

There is no single right way to build a Second Brain. Your system can look like chaos to others, but if it brings you progress and delight, then it’s the right one.  
构建第二大脑没有唯一正确的方法。您的系统在其他人看来可能很混乱, 但如果它能给您带来进步和愉悦, 那么它就是正确的系统。

You may start with one project and slowly move on to more ambitious or complex ones as your skills develop. Or you may find yourself using your Second Brain in completely unexpected ways that you hadn’t envisioned.  
您可以从一个项目开始, 然后随着技能的发展慢慢转向更雄心勃勃或更复杂的项目。或者, 您可能会发现自己以完全出乎意料的方式使用您的第二大脑, 这是您没有预料到的。

As your needs change, give yourself the freedom to discard or take on whichever parts serve you. This isn’t a “take it or leave it” ideology where you must accept all of it or none of it. If any part doesn’t make sense or doesn’t resonate with you, put it aside. Mix and match the tools and techniques you’ve learned in this book to suit your needs. This is how you ensure your Second Brain remains a lifelong companion through the seasons of your life.  
随着您的需求发生变化, 给自己自由丢弃或接受任何适合您的部分。这不是一种 “接受或放弃” 的意识形态, 在这种意识形态中, 您必须全部接受或不接受。如果任何部分没有意义或没有引起您的共鸣, 请将其放在一边。混合搭配您在本书中学到的工具和技术以满足您的需要。这就是您如何确保您的第二大脑在您生命的各个季节都成为终生伴侣。

Wherever you are at this moment—just starting a practice to consistently take notes, or finding ways to more effectively organize and resurface your best thinking, or generating more original and impactful work—you can always fall back on the four steps of CODE:  
无论此时此刻您身在何处——只是开始练习持续记笔记, 或想方设法更有效地组织和重现您的最佳想法, 或生成更具原创性和影响力的作品——您始终可以回到 CODE 的四个步骤:

*   Keep what resonates (Capture) 保持共鸣 (捕捉)
*   Save for actionability (Organize)  
    保存可操作性 (组织)
*   Find the essence (Distill) 找到本质 (蒸馏)
*   Show your work (Express) 展示你的作品 (Express)

If at any point you feel overwhelmed, take a step back and focus on what is immediately necessary: your most important projects and priorities. Scale back to only the notes you need to move those priorities forward. Instead of trying to architect your entire Second Brain system from scratch up front, focus on moving one project at a time through each step from capturing to expressing. When you do so, you’ll find that the steps are much easier and more flexible than you imagined.  
如果您在任何时候感到不知所措, 请退后一步, 专注于立即需要的事情: 您最重要的项目和优先事项。缩小到只需要将这些优先级向前移动的注释。与其尝试从头开始构建整个 “第二大脑” 系统, 不如专注于一次完成一个项目, 完成从捕捉到表达的每一步。当你这样做的时候, 你会发现这些步骤比你想象的要简单和灵活得多。

You can also simplify things by focusing on just one stage of building your Second Brain. Think about where you are now and where you want to be in the near future:  
您还可以通过只关注构建第二大脑的一个阶段来简化事情。想想你现在在哪里, 以及你想在不久的将来去哪里:

*   Are you hoping to remember more? Focus on developing the practice of capturing and organizing your notes according to your projects, commitments, and interests using PARA.  
    你希望记住更多吗? 专注于根据使用 PARA 的项目、承诺和兴趣来记录和组织笔记。
*   Are you hoping to connect ideas and develop your ability to plan, influence, and grow in your personal and professional life? Experiment with consistently distilling and refining your notes using Progressive Summarization and revisiting them during weekly reviews.  
    您是否希望在您的个人和职业生活中联系想法并发展您的计划、影响和成长能力? 尝试使用渐进式总结不断提炼和完善您的笔记, 并在每周回顾时重新访问它们。
*   Are you committed to producing more and better output with less frustration and stress? Focus on creating one Intermediate Packet at a time and looking for opportunities to share them in ever more bold ways.  
    您是否致力于以更少的挫折和压力产生更多更好的输出? 专注于一次创建一个中间包, 并寻找机会以更大胆的方式分享它们。

As you begin your journey, here are twelve practical steps you can take right now to get your Second Brain started. Each one of them is a starting point to begin establishing the habits of personal knowledge management in your life:  
当您开始您的旅程时, 您可以立即采取以下十二个实用步骤来启动您的第二大脑。它们中的每一个都是 一个开始在你的生活中建立个人知识管理习惯的起点:

1.  **Decide what you want to capture.** Think about your Second Brain as an intimate commonplace book or journal. What do you most want to capture, learn, explore, or share? Identify two to three kinds of content that you already value to get started with.  
    确定要捕获的内容。将您的 “第二大脑” 想象成一本私密的普通书籍或期刊。您最想捕捉、学习、探索或分享什么? 确定您已经重视并开始使用的两到三种内容。
2.  **Choose your notes app.** If you don’t use a digital notes app, get started with one now. See Chapter 3 and use the free guide at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources) for up-to-date comparisons and recommendations.  
    选择您的笔记应用程序。如果您不使用数字笔记应用程序, 请立即开始使用。请参阅第 3 章并使用 Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 上的免费指南获取最新的比较和建议。
3.  **Choose a capture tool.** I recommend starting with a read later app to begin saving any article or other piece of online content you’re interested in for later consumption. Believe me, this one step will change the way you think about consuming content forever.  
    选择捕获工具。我建议从稍后阅读的应用程序开始, 以开始保存您感兴趣的任何文章或其他在线内容以供以后使用。相信我, 这一步将永远改变您对消费内容的看法。
4.  **Get set up with PARA.** Set up the four folders of PARA (Projects; Areas; Resources; Archives) and, with a focus on actionability, create a dedicated folder (or tag) for each of your currently active projects. Focus on capturing notes related to those projects from this point forward.  
    使用 PARA 进行设置。设置 PARA 的四个文件夹 (项目; 区域; 资源; 档案), 并以可操作性为重点, 为每个当前活动的项目创建一个专用文件夹 (或标签)。从现在开始, 专注于记录与这些项目相关的笔记。
5.  **Get inspired by identifying your twelve favorite problems.** Make a list of some of your favorite problems, save the list as a note, and revisit it any time you need ideas for what to capture. Use these open-ended questions as a filter to decide which content is worth keeping.  
    通过确定您最喜欢的十二个问题来获得灵感。列出一些您最喜欢的问题, 将列表保存为便条, 并在需要捕获什么的想法时随时重新访问它。使用这些开放式问题作为过滤器来决定哪些内容值得保留。
6.  **Automatically capture your ebook highlights.** Set up a free integration to automatically send highlights from your reading apps (such as a read later or ebook app) to your digital notes (see my recommendations at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/resources)).  
    自动捕捉您的电子书亮点。设置免费集成, 自动将阅读应用程序 (例如稍后阅读或电子书应用程序) 中的精彩内容发送到数字 notes(请参阅我在 Buildingasecondbrain.com/resources 上的建议)。
7.  **Practice Progressive Summarization.** Summarize a group of notes related to a project you’re currently working on using multiple layers of highlighting to see how it affects the way you interact with those notes.  
    练习渐进式总结。总结一组与您当前正在处理的项目相关的笔记, 使用多层突出显示来查看它如何影响您与这些笔记交互的方式。
8.  **Experiment with just one Intermediate Packet.** Choose a project that might be vague, sprawling, or simply hard, and pick just _one_ piece of it to work on—an Intermediate Packet. Maybe it is a business proposal, a chart, a run of show for an event, or key topics for a meeting with your boss. Break the project down into smaller pieces, make a first pass at one of the pieces, and share it with at least one person to get feedback.  
    只用一个中间数据包进行试验。选择一个可能模糊、庞大或简单困难的项目, 然后只选择其中的一部分来处理——一个中间包。也许它是一份商业计划书、一张图表、一场活动的演出, 或者是与老板会面的关键话题。将项目分解成更小的部分, 对其中一个部分进行第一次检查, 并与至少一个人分享以获得反馈。
9.  **Make progress on one deliverable.** Choose a project deliverable you’re responsible for and, using the Express techniques of Archipelago of Ideas, Hemingway Bridge, and Dial Down the Scope, see if you can make decisive progress on it using only the notes in your Second Brain.  
    在一项可交付成果上取得进展。选择一个你负责的项目可交付成果, 并使用 Archipelago of Ideas、Hemingway Bridge 和 Dial Down the Scope 的快速表达技术, 看看你是否可以仅使用第二大脑中的笔记就可以取得决定性的进展。
10.  **Schedule a Weekly Review.** Put a weekly recurring meeting with yourself on your calendar to begin establishing the habit of conducting a Weekly Review. To start, just clear your notes inbox and decide on your priorities for the week. From there, you can add other steps as your confidence grows.  
    安排每周回顾。将每周与自己的定期会议记在日历上, 开始养成进行每周回顾的习惯。首先, 只需清除您的笔记收件箱并确定本周的优先事项。随着信心的增强, 您可以从那里添加其他步骤。
11.  **Assess your notetaking proficiency.** Evaluate your current notetaking practices and areas for potential improvement using our free assessment tool at [Buildingasecondbrain.com/quiz](http://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/quiz).  
    评估你的笔记能力。使用我们位于 Buildingasecondbrain.com/quiz 的免费评估工具, 评估您当前的记笔记做法和可能改进的领域。
12.  **Join the PKM community.** On Twitter, LinkedIn, Substack, Medium, or your platform(s) of choice, follow and subscribe to thought leaders and join communities who are creating content related to personal knowledge management (#PKM), #SecondBrain, #BASB, or #toolsforthought. Share your top takeaways from this book or anything else you’ve realized or discovered. There’s nothing more effective for adopting new behaviors than surrounding yourself with people who already have them.  
    加入 PKM 社区。在 Twitter、LinkedIn、Substack、Medium 或您选择的平台上, 关注并订阅思想领袖并加入创建与个人知识管理 (#PKM)、#SecondBrain、#BASB 或 #toolsforthought 相关内容的社区. 分享您从这本书或您意识到或发现的任何其他事情中获得的最重要的 takeaways。没有什么比与已经拥有这些行为的人在一起更有效地采用新行为了。

While building a Second Brain is a project—something you can commit to and achieve within a reasonable period of time—_using_ your Second Brain is a lifelong practice. I recommend you revisit _Building a Second Brain_ at various points over time. I guarantee you’ll notice things you missed the first time.  
虽然构建第二大脑是一个项目——你可以在合理的时间内致力于并实现的项目——但使用你的第二大脑是一项终身实践。我建议您随着时间的推移在不同的时间点重新访问构建第二个大脑。我保证你会注意到你第一次错过的事情。

Whether you focus on implementing one aspect of the CODE Method, make a full commitment to the entire process, or something in between, you are taking on a new relationship with the information in your life. You are developing a new relationship to your own attention and energy. You are committing to a new identity in which you are in charge of the information swirling around you, even if you don’t always know what it means.  
无论您专注于实施 CODE 方法的一个方面, 对整个过程做出全面承诺, 还是介于两者之间, 您都在与生活中的信息建立一种新的关系。您正在与自己的注意力和精力建立新的关系。你正在致力于一个新的身份, 在这个身份中你负责在你周围盘旋的信息, 即使你并不总是知道它意味着什么。

As you embark on the lifelong path of personal knowledge management, remember that you’ve achieved success before. There have been practices that you’d never heard of before, that are now integral parts of your life. There have been habits and skills that seemed impossible to master, that you now can’t imagine living without. There have been new technologies that you swore you would never embrace that you now use every day. This is the same—what seems unfamiliar and strange now will eventually feel completely natural.  
当您踏上个人知识管理的终生之路时, 请记住您以前取得过成功。有一些您以前从未听说过的做法, 现在已成为您生活中不可或缺的一部分。有些习惯和技能似乎无法掌握, 你现在无法想象没有它们的生活。有一些你发誓永远不会接受的新技术, 但你现在每天都在使用。这是一样的——现在看起来陌生和陌生的东西最终会变得完全自然。

If I could leave you with one last bit of advice, it is to chase what excites you. When you are captivated and obsessed by a story, an idea, or a new possibility, don’t just let that moment pass as if it doesn’t matter. Those are the moments that are truly precious, and that no technology can produce for you. Run after your obsessions with everything you have.  
如果我能给你最后一点建议, 那就是去追逐让你兴奋的事情。当你被一个故事、一个想法或一个新的可能性所吸引和着迷时, 不要让那一刻过去, 就好像它无关紧要一样。那些是真正珍贵的时刻, 任何技术都无法为您呈现。追逐你所拥有的一切。

Just be sure to take notes along the way.  
请务必在整个过程中做笔记。

Bonus Chapter How to Create a Tagging System That Works  
奖金章节 如何创建有效的标记系统

I wrote this book to give you a new way to think about the knowledge that matters to you. It’s designed to give anyone a path to create—and benefit from—a Second Brain and provides an introduction to the fascinating world of personal knowledge management.  
我写这本书是为了给你一种新的方式来思考对你重要的知识。它旨在为任何人提供创建第二大脑并从中受益的途径, 并介绍个人知识管理的迷人世界。

The practice begins and ends with notetaking—including capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing information, ideas, and packets of work. The specific techniques in the CODE chapters are the best place to get started. However, one of the most common questions I receive is about the advanced skill of tagging.  
练习以记笔记开始和结束——包括捕捉、组织、提炼和表达信息、想法和工作包。 CODE 章节中的特定技术是入门的最佳起点。但是, 我收到的最常见问题之一是关于标记的高级技能。

I’ve compiled a bonus chapter on how to create a tagging system for your Second Brain following the principle of actionability. Although not essential for getting started, tags do provide an extra layer of organization that can be useful as your knowledge collection grows.  
我编写了一个额外的章节, 介绍如何根据可操作性原则为您的第二大脑创建标记系统。虽然对于入门来说不是必需的, 但标签确实提供了一个额外的组织层, 随着您的知识收集的增长, 它会很有用。

Acknowledgments
---------------

I’m sitting here at my usual writing spot weeks after my manuscript deadline has passed. I’ve postponed the writing of these acknowledgments for as long as possible because it feels almost impossible. The number of people who have contributed to and touched this book along the way is staggering. The depth of gratitude I feel for all the love and energy and intelligence that they have poured into me is difficult to put into words. But I’ll try.  
在我的稿件截止日期过去几周后, 我坐在我平常的写作地点。我已经尽可能推迟写这些致谢, 因为感觉几乎不可能。一路上为这本书做出贡献和感动的人数之多令人咋舌。我对他们倾注在我身上的所有爱、能量和智慧的感激之情难以用语言表达。但我会努力的。

Thank you to Stephanie Hitchcock and the team at Atria for your willingness to take a chance on a novel idea and a first-time author. This book exists only because you saw its potential and committed to seeing it realized. I’m deeply grateful to my editor, Janet Goldstein, for wrangling my words (and sometimes me!) into a message far clearer and more elegant than anything I could have come up with on my own. My agent, Lisa DiMona, has graciously guided me through every step of the publishing journey from the earliest days of this project. I look forward to working together for many years to come.  
感谢斯蒂芬妮 · 希区柯克 (Stephanie Hitchcock) 和 Atria 的团队, 感谢你们愿意冒险尝试一个新颖的想法和一位新作者。本书之所以存在, 是因为您看到了它的潜力并致力于实现它。我非常感谢我的编辑珍妮特 · 戈德斯坦 (Janet Goldstein), 感谢她将我的话 (有时是我自己!) 整理成一条比我自己想出的任何东西都更清晰、更优雅的信息。我的经纪人 Lisa DiMona 从这个项目的最初几天就亲切地指导我完成了出版之旅的每一步。我期待着在未来的许多年里一起工作。

Thank you to the Forte Labs team and extended network—Betheny Swinehart, Will Mannon, Monica Rysavy, Marc Koenig, Steven Zen, Becca Olason, and Julia Saxena. You’ve been behind the scenes every step of the way making the business work, overcoming challenges, and creating new ways of sharing these ideas with the world. I am continuously amazed by your dedication to excellence. You constantly impress me with your deep commitment to creating lasting, positive change in people’s lives. I look forward to everything we’ll accomplish together.  
感谢 Forte Labs 团队和扩展网络——Betheny Swinehart、Will Mannon、Monica Rysavy、Marc Koenig、Steven Zen、Becca Olason 和 Julia Saxena。在使业务运作、克服挑战以及创造与世界分享这些想法的新方式的过程中, 您一直在幕后的每一步。你对卓越的执着一直让我感到惊讶。 你对为人们的生活创造持久、积极的变化的坚定承诺不断给我留下深刻印象。我期待着我们一起完成的一切。

I’m eternally grateful to Billy Broas for helping me find more powerful ways of communicating my truth beyond my inner circle. To Maya P. Lim for crafting the visual identity that will deliver our education to every corner of the planet. And I’m thankful to the Pen Name team for partnering with me in sharing my life’s work far and wide.  
我永远感谢 Billy Broas 帮助我找到更有效的方式在我的核心圈子之外传达我的真相。感谢 Maya P. Lim 设计的视觉标识, 将我们的教育传播到地球的每一个角落。我感谢 Pen Name 团队与我合作, 广泛分享我一生的工作。

The only way my business (or life) functions is with the help of my “brain trust.” The work I do wouldn’t be half as meaningful or interesting without your unwavering support. David, building a business with you and developing our ideas side by side has been one of the most meaningful endeavors of my career. Joel, you are like a rock in stormy seas. I’ve lost count of how many times dinners in your home served as a stabilizing force when it seemed like everything was going to unravel. Raphael, you came up with the name of the course—and now the book. The laughter you’ve brought into my life has been like a beacon of joy every time I’ve started to take myself too seriously. Derick, in many ways this journey started with our late-night conversations as teenagers about technology and the future—ours and humanity’s. Thank you for entertaining and encouraging those far-fetched ideas, some of which, after all these years, found their way into this book.  
我的事业 (或生活) 运作的唯一方式是在我的 “智囊团” 的帮助下。如果没有您坚定不移的支持, 我所做的工作就不会有意义或有趣。大卫, 与你一起创业并并肩发展我们的想法是我职业生涯中最有意义的努力之一。乔尔, 你就像惊涛骇浪中的一块岩石。我已经记不清有多少次你家的晚餐在一切似乎都要崩溃的时候起到了稳定的作用。拉斐尔, 你想出了课程的名字——现在是书的名字。每当我开始太认真地对待自己时, 你给我的生活带来的笑声就像一盏欢乐的灯塔。德里克, 在很多方面, 这段旅程始于我们十几岁时关于技术和未来的深夜谈话——我们的和人类的。感谢您娱乐和鼓励那些牵强附会的想法, 其中一些想法, 经过这么多年, 终于进入了本书。

I’ve had a series of mentors and advisors who shifted my trajectory in ways I can hardly believe. Thank you to Venkatesh Rao for serving as my introduction to the online world of ideas. A few words of your public support and encouragement fueled my motivation for years. Thank you to David Allen for pioneering the personal productivity field and introducing us to the possibility that we could proactively improve how we worked with and managed information. I have been profoundly influenced and helped by your ideas.  
我有很多导师和顾问, 他们以我难以置信的方式改变了我的轨迹。感谢 Venkatesh Rao 为我介绍网络创意世界。您公开支持和鼓励的几句话激发了我多年的动力。感谢 David Allen 开创了个人生产力领域, 并向我们介绍了我们可以主动改进我们处理和管理信息的方式的可能性。您的想法对我影响很深, 对我帮助很大。

Thank you to Kathy Phelan, not only for believing I was on to something, but for sponsoring and advising me in bringing my work into companies. Your belief in me at the time outshined my own, and your advice and lessons continue to resound years later. Thank you to James Clear for giving so generously of your time and guiding my book writing efforts around many pitfalls and blind spots. At a time when everyone in the world wanted your attention, you chose to give it to a fledgling writer with not much to offer in return. Thank you to Joe Hudson, who came into my life as a friend and mentor at a crucial moment when I needed to learn how to navigate the emotions of the new level of self-expression I was taking on. Thank you to Srini Rao for going all-in with your support of my work and taking a risk in putting your reputation behind it.  
感谢 Kathy Phelan, 不仅是因为他相信我正在做某事, 而且还赞助并建议我将我的工作带入公司。当时您对我的信任超过了我自己, 您的建议和教训在多年后继续回响。感谢 James Clear 慷慨地抽出时间指导我的写作工作, 绕过许多陷阱和盲点。在世界上每个人都想要你的关注的时候, 你选择把它交给一个初出茅庐的作家, 而没有太多回报。感谢乔 · 哈德森 (Joe Hudson), 他在我需要学习如何驾驭自我表达新水平的情绪的关键时刻, 作为朋友和导师出现在我的生活中。感谢 Srini Rao 全力支持我的工作, 并冒着将自己的声誉置于背后的风险。

Thank you to Forte Labs’ followers, subscribers, customers, and students. You are the fuel powering all the capturing, organizing, distilling, and expressing that makes the _Building a Second Brain_ community so vibrant. This book is just as much a distillation of the stories, strategies, and techniques I’ve learned from you over the years as it is my own ideas. You are the ultimate authority on what works and what doesn’t. By taking my courses, reading my writing, and giving me feedback on everything from tweets to book drafts, you’ve opened the door to a future where Second Brains are available to people everywhere. I never expected so many people to believe in what I was doing. Every single day I have your support and attention I consider a miracle.  
感谢 Forte Labs 的关注者、订阅者、客户和学生。您是推动所有捕获、组织、提炼和表达的燃料, 这使得 “构建第二大脑” 社区如此充满活力。这本书既是我多年来从您那里学到的故事、策略和技术的精华, 也是我自己的想法。您是决定什么有效什么无效的最终权威。通过参加我的课程, 阅读我的文章, 并就从推文到书籍草稿的所有内容向我提供反馈, 您已经打开了通向世界各地的人们都可以使用第二大脑的未来之门。我从没想过会有这么多人相信我的所作所为。每一天我都得到你们的支持和关注, 我认为这是一个奇迹。

Everything I am ultimately comes from my family. My soil and my rock, from which the meaning and joy in my life springs. Thank you to my parents, Wayne Forte and Valeria Vassão Forte, for giving me an upbringing that exposed me to countless enriching experiences, cultures, places, and people. Dad, you are my model of what it means to express myself with unsparing honesty and taste, while also upholding my responsibilities as a father, husband, and citizen. Mom, you gave me the gifts to balance out my strong will and sharp tongue—patience, generosity, graciousness, and self-awareness. You both dedicated your lives to making me the kind of person with enough abundance to share with others. So many of the teachings expressed in this book have their origin in the simple, practical lessons you taught me and modeled for me as a child. To my siblings and in-laws, Lucas, Paloma, Marco, Kaitlyn, and Grant. You are my best friends, my confidants, and my lifelong companions. Every time I start to lose sight of who I am and what’s important to me, you bring me back to the soil I came from. I cherish every minute we spend together.  
我的一切最终都来自我的家庭。我的土壤和我的岩石, 我生命中的意义和快乐从中涌现。感谢我的父母 Wayne Forte 和 Valeria Vassão Forte, 是他们在我的成长过程中让我接触到无数丰富的经历、文化、地方和人物。爸爸, 您是我的榜样, 体现了以毫不留情的诚实和品味表达自己的意义, 同时也履行了我作为父亲、丈夫和公民的责任。妈妈, 您给了我天赋来平衡我坚强的意志和尖锐的舌头——耐心、慷慨、仁慈和自我意识。你们俩都献出了自己的生命, 让我成为可以与他人分享的富足之人。本书中表达的许多教义都源于您在孩提时教给我并为我树立榜样的简单、实用的课程。致我的兄弟姐妹和姻亲 Lucas、Paloma、Marco、Kaitlyn 和 Grant。你们是我最好的朋友, 我的知己, 我一生的伴侣。每当我开始忘记我是谁, 什么对我重要时, 你就会把我带回我的故乡。我珍惜我们一起度过的每一分钟。

And finally, from the bottom of my heart I am thankful to you, Lauren and Caio, for making all this worthwhile. Lauren, you have played every role a person can play in my life—partner, lover, cofounder, coach, advisor, and now, wife and mother. You became whoever you needed to become, acquired whichever skills were demanded of you, and ventured into one new territory after another, all to help me reach my dreams. There’s nothing more gratifying in my life than watching you grow and evolve into the most inspiring, genuine, open-hearted person I’ve ever met. I consider it my highest privilege to walk alongside you as you step into your greatness. Caio, you’ve only just arrived, but already I can’t live without you. You make my life so much more colorful and hilarious. My love for you gives me the determination to become the best version of myself I can. My highest hope for this book is that it makes the world a safer, more humane, and more interesting place for you.  
最后, 我发自内心地感谢你们, Lauren 和 Caio, 感谢你们让这一切变得有价值。劳伦, 你在我的生活中扮演了一个人可以扮演的每一个角色——伴侣、情人、联合创始人、教练、顾问, 现在是妻子和母亲。你成为了你想成为的人, 获得了你需要的任何技能, 并冒险进入一个又一个新的领域, 所有这些都是为了帮助我实现我的梦想。在我的生活中, 没有什么比看着你成长并发展成为我见过的最鼓舞人心、最真诚、最开放的人更令人欣慰的了。当你走向伟大时, 我认为能与你并肩同行是我的最高荣幸。 Caio, 你才刚来, 但我已经离不开你了。你让我的生活变得更加丰富多彩和热闹。我对你的爱让我下定决心成为最好的自己。我对这本书的最大希望是, 它能让世界成为一个更安全、更人道、更有趣的地方。
