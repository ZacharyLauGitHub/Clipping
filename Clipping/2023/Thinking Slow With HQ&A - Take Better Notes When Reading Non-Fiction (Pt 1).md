# Thinking Slow With HQ&A: Take Better Notes When Reading Non-Fiction (Pt 1)  使用 HQ&A 慢思考：阅读非小说类作品时做更好的笔记（第 1 部分）

**At a glance 乍看上去**
--------------------

*   **In a nutshell:** As you stumble across valuable information, save it (Highlight) along with a question for which you see the passage as the answer (Question). Then write a compressed version of that passage expressed in your own words (Answer).  
    简而言之：当您偶然发现有价值的信息时，将其保存（突出显示）以及您将文章视为答案的问题（问题）。然后用你自己的话写出该段落的压缩版本（答案）。
*   Highlight, Question, and Answer (HQ&A) Notes are the knife in our knife and fork note-taking toolkit. While [Jump Notes](https://words.jamoe.org/jump-notes/) excel at shallow breadth for when we're thinking fast, HQ&A Notes are designed for narrow depth for when we're thinking slow. Together, they'll help you carve up what you're reading and push your thinking further.  
    重点、问题和答案 (HQ&A) 笔记是我们刀叉笔记工具包中的一把刀。当我们快速思考时，Jump Notes 在浅广度方面表现出色，而 HQ&A Notes 专为我们缓慢思考时的窄深度而设计。它们将一起帮助您划分正在阅读的内容并进一步推动您的思考。
*   Using the HQ&A note-taking technique when reading non-fiction will leave you with flashcard-style notes that will promote your ability to retain and recall information over the long term while giving you evergreen notes to reuse and remix. The outcome is more original and efficient thinking.  
    在阅读非小说类作品时使用 HQ&A 笔记技术会给你留下抽认卡式的笔记，这将提高你长期保留和回忆信息的能力，同时让你的笔记常青，可以重复使用和重新组合。结果是更加原创和有效的思考。
*   The HQ&A technique can be used with or without a computer, offering a powerful, practical but lightweight approach whenever narrow depth is your priority. With it, you'll be able to capture the best insights from what you're reading.  
    HQ&A 技术可以在有或没有计算机的情况下使用，当您优先考虑狭窄深度时，它提供了一种强大、实用但轻巧的方法。有了它，您将能够从阅读的内容中获得最佳见解。
*   Once written, you can use your HQ&A Notes as fertiliser when writing original pieces of work (essays, articles, blogs) throughout your studies and career.  
    写完后，您可以在整个学习和职业生涯中撰写原创作品（散文、文章、博客）时，将 HQ&A 笔记用作肥料。

****Introduction 介绍****
-----------------------

The 21st century is an information fire hose. Being able to adjust, filter and turn information into insights has become a basic expectation. We must think deeply on a deadline.  
21 世纪是信息消防水龙带。能够调整、过滤并将信息转化为洞察力已成为一种基本期望。我们必须对最后期限进行深入思考。

The classic note-taking techniques haven't caught up with the times. That's why we've created two new techniques: the Highlight, Question and Answer (HQ&A) technique and [Jump Notes](https://words.jamoe.org/jump-notes/).  
经典的笔记技巧还没有跟上时代的步伐。这就是为什么我们创造了两种新技术：突出显示、问答 (HQ&A) 技术和跳转笔记。

We'll be focusing on the HQ&A technique in this article. We’ll unpack the workflow for taking a HQ&A note when reading non-fiction, offer some examples, and then, once you've got the foundations sorted, share a more advanced application of the technique that promotes original thinking.  
我们将在本文中重点介绍 HQ&A 技术。我们将解开在阅读非小说类作品时做 HQ&A 笔记的工作流程，提供一些示例，然后，一旦您整理好基础，分享促进原创思维的技术的更高级应用。

Before that, it's worth checking that the note-taking technique aligns with your goals. Being the knife in our knife and fork note-taking toolkit, the HQ&A technique is for when narrow depth is a priority. That is, you're reading something that is honestly worth distilling and understanding on a deeper level for the sake of your studies, work, or intellectual curiosity.  
在此之前，值得检查记笔记的技巧是否符合您的目标。作为我们刀叉笔记工具包中的刀，HQ&A 技术适用于优先考虑窄深度的情况。也就是说，为了您的学习、工作或求知欲，您正在阅读一些真正值得提炼和更深层次理解的东西。

If shallow depth is your priority, our [Jump Note](https://words.jamoe.org/jump-notes/) technique will be a better fit. This technique is for when we're thinking fast like if we're exploring a new topic or slowing down to take more thoughtful notes isn't preferable or practical.  
如果浅深度是您的首选，我们的 Jump Note 技术将更适合。这种技术适用于我们快速思考的时候，比如我们正在探索一个新主题或放慢速度做更周到的笔记是不可取或不切实际的。

**Designing the Honest Notes method  
设计 Honest Notes 方法**
----------------------------------------------------------

For both HQ&A and Jump Notes, we've designed them with the following key requirements in mind:  
对于 HQ&A 和 Jump Notes，我们在设计它们时考虑了以下关键要求：

*   ****Snappy, but not too snappy**** – note-taking techniques shouldn't take the joy out of reading by being too time-consuming, especially in a world full of academic and career deadlines. It also can't be too easy, as if you highlight everything, you've highlighted nothing.  
    活泼，但不要太活泼——记笔记技巧不应该因为太耗时而剥夺阅读的乐趣，尤其是在充满学术和职业截止日期的世界里。它也不会太容易，就好像你突出了一切，你没有突出任何东西。
*   ****Evergreen notes for idea remixing**** – cross-pollinating ideas from notes taken years apart is idea remixing. If we read something, we want that time investment to remain valuable. We want the notes to be evergreen.  
    创意混合的常青笔记——从相隔多年的笔记中交叉授粉的想法就是创意混合。如果我们读了一些东西，我们希望时间投资仍然有价值。我们希望音符常青。
*   ****Understanding and memory**** – it should nudge us towards engaging with whatever we're reading, so new insights stick and minds don't wander.  
    理解和记忆——它应该推动我们参与我们正在阅读的任何东西，这样新的见解就会留下来，思想就不会走神。
*   ****Bias for original thinking**** – reading is playing back someone else's thoughts in our own mind. But we want to develop our own original thoughts; our note-taking system should be designed accordingly.  
    原创思维的偏见——阅读是在自己的脑海中回放别人的想法。但是我们想发展自己的原创思想；我们的笔记系统应该相应地设计。
*   ****Flexib**ility** – the technique should work whether we're using a computer or not and be practical regardless of which form of non-fiction we're consuming, e.g. books, articles, lectures, podcasts, cereal boxes.  
    灵活性——无论我们是否使用计算机，该技术都应该有效，并且无论我们正在消费哪种形式的非小说类作品，该技术都应该实用，例如书籍、文章、讲座、播客、麦片盒。
*   ****Easy** to **review**** – reviewing our notes for retention, finding answers and being inspired should be fast. That means working with how we think, not against it.  
    易于复习——复习我们的笔记以保持记忆、找到答案和获得灵感应该很快。这意味着与我们的想法一起工作，而不是反对它。

****Putting the Highlight, Question and Answer (HQ&A) technique into practice  
将突出显示、问答 (HQ&A) 技术付诸实践****
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let's start with an example of the end product and then unpack it.  
让我们从最终产品的示例开始，然后将其拆包。

Below is one of the HQ&A Notes we took while reading [_The Silk Roads: A New History of the World_](https://amzn.to/3rgfOA1) by Peter Frankopan.  
以下是我们在阅读彼得 · 弗兰科潘 (Peter Frankopan) 的《丝绸之路：世界新史》时所做的 HQ&A 笔记之一。

The Highlight is an extract from the text, while the Question and Answer are creatures of our own creation:  
亮点是文本的摘录，而问题和答案是我们自己创造的：

**Highlight:** 'So widespread was slavery in the Mediterranean and the Arabic world that even today regular greetings reference human trafficking. All over Italy, when they meet, people say to each other,"schiavo", from a Venetian dialect."Ciao", as it is more commonly spelt, does not mean"hello"; it means"I am your slave".' p.122  
亮点：“地中海和阿拉伯世界的奴隶制如此普遍，以至于即使在今天，常规的问候语也会提到贩卖人口。在整个意大利，人们见面时都会互相说 “schiavo”，这是一种威尼斯方言。 “Ciao”，因为它更常见的拼写，并不意味着 “你好”；意思是 “我是你的奴隶”。第 122 页

**Question:** What Italian word signals how much wealth Venice made from slavery?  
问题：哪个意大利语词表示威尼斯从奴隶制中赚取了多少财富？

**Answer:** 'Ciao', which comes from 'schiavo'. It's a Venetian dialect for the word'slave'and literally translates as'I am your slave.'  
答：'Ciao'，来自'schiavo'。这是 “奴隶” 一词的威尼斯方言，直译为“我是你的奴隶”。

The technique is simple, process-light and great for deep thinking. The three evidence-based reasons why the HQ&A approach is effective for learning and idea-generation are:  
该技术简单、流程简单，非常适合深度思考。 HQ&A 方法对学习和创意产生有效的三个基于证据的原因是：

*   ****Application of information:**** information you can apply becomes an insight. By thinking of a question, you force your mind to understand its meaning and draw connections. That switch from passive to active is what makes whatever you're reading stick.  
    信息的应用：你可以应用的信息变成了一种洞察力。通过思考一个问题，您会强迫自己的思想理解其含义并建立联系。这种从被动到主动的转变使你正在阅读的任何东西都能坚持下去。
*   ****Designed for** r**etention and** r**ecall:**** while you're reading, you're also creating lightweight flashcards for the future.  
    专为记忆和回忆而设计：在阅读的同时，您也在为未来创建轻量级的抽认卡。
*   ****Friendly friction:**** by requiring some effort, you'll be able to dodge the trap of highlighting everything. Instead, you’ll develop an eye for spotting the truly insightful points that are worth noting down. That'll make you more efficient and keep you honest.  
    友好摩擦：通过付出一些努力，您将能够避开突出显示所有内容的陷阱。相反，你会培养一种发现真正有洞察力的观点的眼光，这些观点值得记下来。这将使您更有效率并保持诚实。

These benefits are also why the [Feynman Technique](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/feynman-technique) and [Spaced Repetition](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/spaced-repetition) are the most effective techniques for learning, and the HQ&A method has their pedagogical principles baked right in. That way, your default note-taking approach is also the most effective approach.  
这些好处也是为什么费曼技术和间隔重复是最有效的学习技术，而 HQ&A 方法也有其教学原则。这样一来，您默认的记笔记方法也是最有效的方法。

****Foundations: What are the three steps** for **taking a HQ&A note?  
基础：做 HQ&A 笔记的三个步骤是什么？****
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The technique must be snappy but not too snappy. So, there are three steps that have some friendly friction built-in to avoid taking lazy notes:  
该技术必须活泼但又不能太活泼。因此，有一些内置的友好摩擦可以避免懒惰记笔记的三个步骤：

1.  ****Highlight:**** when reading, an insight might catch your attention. Highlight the passage that best captures that insight, either directly or by writing it down elsewhere for easy reference.  
    亮点：阅读时，某个见解可能会引起您的注意。突出显示最能捕捉到该见解的段落，直接或将其写在其他地方以便于参考。
2.  ****Question:**** if your highlight is the answer, what's the question? This is your mental workout and is where the friendly friction comes in. Think of a precise question for which the answer is what you've highlighted. By applying the new insight, you'll reinforce your understanding.  
    问题：如果你的亮点是答案，问题是什么？这是您的心理锻炼，也是友好摩擦的来源。想一个精确的问题，答案就是您突出显示的内容。通过应用新的见解，您将加强您的理解。
3.  ****Answer:**** write, in your own words, the answer to your question. This final step forces you to compress the author's words, reinforce your understanding, and give you a crisp summary to recall later.  
    答案：用你自己的话写下你问题的答案。这最后一步迫使你压缩作者的话，加强你的理解，并给你一个清晰的总结以备日后回忆。

****Foundations: Deconstructing the HQ&A note example from earlier  
基础：解构之前的 HQ&A 注释示例****
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When reading, each component of the HQ&A note serves to improve your memory, focus and understanding:  
阅读时，HQ&A 笔记的每个部分都有助于提高您的记忆力、注意力和理解力：

*   ****Highlight**** = The original context for your reference.  
    突出显示 = 原始上下文供您参考。
*   ****Question**** = An application of the new information to form an insight.  
    问题 = 应用新信息形成见解。
*   ****Answer**** = A compressed version of the highlight's insight expressed in your own words.  
    答案 = 用您自己的话表达的亮点见解的压缩版本。

Unpacking the thought process behind the HQ&A note, we took when reading _[The Silk Road](https://amzn.to/3rgfOA1)_:  
解开 HQ&A 注释背后的思考过程，我们在阅读《丝绸之路》时记下了：

****Foundations: How to review** your **HQ&A** N**ote**s  
基础：如何查看您的 HQ&A 笔记**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Don't read the highlight first: 不要先阅读重点：

1.  ****Read your question first:**** as you would a flashcard, quiz yourself. By reading the question first, you’ll re-enter the headspace you were in when you first wrote the note.  
    首先阅读您的问题：就像阅读抽认卡一样，对自己进行测验。通过先阅读问题，您将重新进入第一次写笔记时所在的顶空。
2.  ****Recall the answer:**** try to recall the answer, and then see how you did. This will reinforce your memory of the note per the active recall technique featured in our [Spaced Repetition](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/spaced-repetition) and [Feynman Technique](https://www.jamoe.org/redraft/feynman-technique) articles.  
    回忆答案：试着回忆答案，然后看看你做得如何。这将根据我们的间隔重复和费曼技术文章中介绍的主动回忆技术加强您对音符的记忆。
3.  ****(Optional) Read the highlight:**** if the question and answer didn't make sense or you want a reminder of the little details, you can re-read the highlight. With this approach, you can review your notes and jump between your compressed answer and the full context of the highlight.  
    （可选）阅读要点：如果问题和答案没有意义，或者您想提醒一下细节，您可以重新阅读要点。使用这种方法，您可以查看您的笔记并在您的压缩答案和突出显示的完整上下文之间跳转。

To make it more real, here are two more HQ&A Notes. They’ll give you a feel for how you can adapt your questions to strike at the heart of the insight(s) you want to remember.  
为了让它更真实，这里还有两个 HQ&A Notes。它们会让您了解如何调整您的问题以触及您想要记住的洞察力的核心。

The notes should be read Question, Answer, and Highlight, so they’ve been re-ordered to reflect how one would review the notes after having written them.  
笔记应该阅读问题、答案和重点，因此它们被重新排序以反映人们在写完笔记后如何回顾笔记。

To see more real-world examples, you can view the notes we made while reading Bill Gates' 2021 book _How to Avoid Climate Disaster_ [here](https://words.jamoe.org/example-notes-how-to-avoid-climate-disaster-2021-bill-gates/).

**Question:** What's shocking about class-size and academic achievement?  
问题：班级规模和学业成绩有什么令人震惊的地方？

**Answer:** There is no statistically significant evidence to support the belief that small class-size results in stronger academic achievements. Follows an inverted U-curve. Too small = too little energy. Uninspired. Too big = too much energy. Unruly.  
回答：没有统计上显着的证据支持小班授课会带来更好的学业成绩这一信念。遵循倒 U 型曲线。太小 = 能量太少。没有灵感。太大 = 能量太大。不羁。

**Highlight:** 'After sorting through thousands of pages of data on student performance from eighteen separate countries, the economists concluded that... the evidence suggests the thing we are convinced is such a big advantage might not be such an advantage at all.' p.44  
要点：“在对来自 18 个不同国家的学生表现的数千页数据进行整理后，经济学家得出结论…… 证据表明，我们确信如此巨大的优势可能根本不是这样的优势。” 第 44 页

**Question:** How was product testing for animal fur done by the caliph in the 8th century?  
问：8 世纪的哈里发如何对动物毛皮进行产品测试？

**Answer:** 12 different animal furs were wrapped around water vessels and placed outside overnight. The one that didn't freeze was the warmest animal fur, and thus, the highest quality. The winner was black fox fur.  
答案：将 12 种不同的动物毛皮包裹在水器上，放在外面过夜。不冻的是最暖和的动物皮毛，因此也是最高品质的。获胜者是黑狐皮。

**Highlight:** ‘One caliph in the eighth century went so far as to conduct a series of experiments to freeze a range of different furs to see which offers the best protection in extreme conditions. He filled a series of containers with water and left them overnight in ice-cold weather according to one Arabic writer. “All were frozen except the one with black fox fur. He thus learned which fur was the warmest and the driest.”' p.107  
亮点：“8 世纪的一位哈里发甚至进行了一系列实验，将一系列不同的毛皮冷冻起来，看看哪一种在极端条件下能提供最好的保护。据一位阿拉伯作家说，他在一系列容器中装满水，然后在冰冷的天气中放置它们过夜。 “除了那只长着黑狐皮的，其他都被冻住了。他因此了解到哪种皮毛最温暖和最干燥。” 第 107 页

****Experiment: See if the technique will work for you  
实验：看看这项技术是否适合你****
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Start small. Find a piece of non-fiction and take a few HQ&A Notes.  
从小做起。找一篇非小说类作品，做一些 HQ&A 笔记。

When you start with the technique, it's normal to struggle to think of questions. That's because active reading is usually an unfamiliar mental muscle. With practice, applying the new ideas from the text and expressing them in your own words will become easier.  
当您开始使用该技巧时，很难想出问题是很正常的。那是因为主动阅读通常是一种不熟悉的智力肌肉。通过练习，应用课文中的新想法并用自己的话表达它们会变得更容易。

Questions don't need to be complicated, nor do they need to weave in every aspect of what you've highlighted. They just need to get to the heart of what you want to take away from the text.  
问题不需要很复杂，也不需要涉及你所强调的各个方面。他们只需要了解您想从文本中获取的内容的核心。

That is, whatever you think will honestly be useful for achieving your goals.  
也就是说，无论您认为对实现您的目标是否真的有用。

The next day, review your notes. Quiz yourself using the questions you wrote, and see if you can recall the insights. Then reaffirm your understanding with the answers and highlights you made.  
第二天，复习你的笔记。用你写的问题测验自己，看看你是否能回忆起这些见解。然后用你所做的答案和亮点重申你的理解。

****Advanced: Promoting original thinking** by speculating with unanswered questions  
高级：通过推测未回答的问题来促进原创思维**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After grasping the foundations of the HQ&A technique, you'll see that it's most useful for questions answered in the text, but what about unanswered questions?  
在掌握了 HQ&A 技术的基础之后，您会发现它对文本中已回答的问题最有用，但未回答的问题呢？

These speculative questions are new ideas, connections or gaps in the text that you may want to follow up on to solidify your understanding of a new topic, as shown in the example below. The benefit of capturing them is that they'll serve as fertiliser for new essays, articles, investigations and Tweets.  
这些推测性问题是文本中的新想法、联系或空白，您可能希望跟进这些内容以巩固您对新主题的理解，如下例所示。捕获它们的好处是它们可以作为新论文、文章、调查和推文的肥料。

Like all notes, we may never use them. That's fine. Storing ideas for the future is only part of the value of taking notes. The other part is digging intellectual rabbit holes that strengthen our thinking skills.  
像所有笔记一样，我们可能永远不会使用它们。没关系。为未来储存想法只是做笔记的部分价值。另一部分是挖掘智力兔子洞，增强我们的思维能力。

Practically, the process of taking an unanswered HQ&A note is the same: find the Highlight that inspired your Question; write your Question; write your educated guess as to what you think the answer might be.  
实际上，记录未回答的 HQ&A 笔记的过程是相同的：找到激发您问题的亮点；写下你的问题；写下您认为答案可能是什么的有根据的猜测。

When you come to review your unanswered HQ&A Notes, you'll have a reminder of what you were thinking at that moment and be able to use it as a springboard.  
当您查看未答复的 HQ&A 笔记时，您会得到一个提醒，提醒您当时的想法，并能够将其用作跳板。

Of course, sometimes you’ll want to record a question but have no clue how to answer it. For these occasions, it's fine to leave it blank. You can always follow up later if the answer to that question becomes important for something you're working on.  
当然，有时您会想记录一个问题，但不知道如何回答。在这些情况下，将其留空就可以了。如果该问题的答案对您正在从事的工作很重要，您可以随时跟进。

### **U**nanswered question example 未回答的问题示例****

Below is a Speculative HQ&A note we took while reading [_Moneyland: Why Thieves And Crooks Now Rule The World And How To Take It Back_](https://amzn.to/387PVee) by Oliver Bullough.  
以下是我们在阅读 Moneyland 时记下的投机性 HQ&A 笔记：Oliver Bullough 撰写的《为什么小偷和骗子现在统治世界以及如何夺回它》。

For context, ‘Moneyland’ is the name given to the nebulous location that houses illegal money. That is, money that’s been off-shored for tax evasion or to hide stolen funds:  
就上下文而言，“Moneyland” 是指存放非法资金的模糊地点的名称。也就是说，因逃税或隐藏被盗资金而离岸的资金：

**Question:** Would Bitcoin increase or decrease money laundering via Moneyland, that is, money earned through corruption and crime?  
问题：比特币会增加还是减少通过 Moneyland 进行的洗钱活动，即通过腐败和犯罪赚取的钱？

**Answer:** Bitcoin is a means of transferring value, so I presume it cannot, by itself combat money laundering. The blockchain, with better indexing tools, however, may make it easier to track the flow and source of funds in the future. (?)  
答：比特币是一种转移价值的手段，所以我认为它本身不能打击洗钱活动。然而，具有更好索引工具的区块链可能会在未来更容易追踪资金的流动和来源。 (?)

**Highlight:** 'Moneyland exists because it makes money for its stewards, who are well paid for serving its wealthy citizens. They, not the Moneylanders, are the tigers whose claws and teeth are shell companies, trusts and secret bank account.' p.74  
亮点：“Moneyland 之所以存在，是因为它为其管家赚钱，这些管家为富有的市民服务而获得丰厚的报酬。他们，而不是 Moneylanders，是老虎，它们的爪子和牙齿是空壳公司、信托和秘密银行账户。第 74 页

The question mark (?) is how we recommend identifying speculative questions that need further investigation and development before they can be considered fully formed.  
问号 (?) 是我们建议如何识别需要进一步调查和发展才能被视为完全形成的推测性问题。

The benefit of doing this is that it helps us think faster in the future. Imagine that we end up needing to write a piece on the connection between money laundering and cryptocurrencies. We might stumble across the above unanswered HQ&A note. Giving us a starting point can use it as a springboard to make the research and writing process faster. That's all part of achieving more with less by using yesterday's momentum.  
这样做的好处是它可以帮助我们在未来更快地思考。想象一下，我们最终需要写一篇关于洗钱和加密货币之间联系的文章。我们可能会偶然发现上述未答复的 HQ&A 注释。给我们一个起点，可以作为一个跳板，让研究和写作过程更快。这就是利用昨日的势头实现事半功倍的全部内容。

****Conclusion 结论****
---------------------

We've covered the most basic form of the Highlight, Question and Answer (HQ&A) note-taking technique. However, view it as a serving suggestion. As long as you keep the principles in place, you can customise it to your needs.  
我们已经介绍了突出显示、问答 (HQ&A) 笔记技术的最基本形式。但是，将其视为服务建议。只要您遵守这些原则，就可以根据您的需要对其进行自定义。

For example, as you become more comfortable, you can start thinking about taking HQ&A Notes at different levels of abstraction. At first, you'll take a HQ&A note to summarise paragraphs. As your active reading skills develop, you might then venture into using the HQ&A technique to summarise multiple pages, a chapter, or an entire book.  
例如，当你变得更自在时，你可以开始考虑在不同的抽象层次上做 HQ&A 笔记。首先，您将使用 HQ&A 笔记来总结段落。随着主动阅读技能的发展，您可能会冒险使用 HQ&A 技术来总结多页、一章或整本书。

For these higher level HQ&A Notes, you'll want to use the Highlight that best captures the crux of the insight you want to store it for later. Once you've found it, think of a poignant question that will prompt you to recall that insight.  
对于这些更高级别的 HQ&A 注释，您将希望使用最能捕捉到您想要存储以供日后使用的洞察力要点的突出显示。找到它后，想想一个尖锐的问题，它会促使你回忆起那个洞察力。
