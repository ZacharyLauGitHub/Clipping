About two years ago, I began using a tool to capture my ideas: [**Roam Research.  
大约两年前，我开始使用一种工具来捕捉我的想法：Roam Research。**](http://www.roamresearch.com/)

In the beginning, I used Roam as a dumping ground of information. Whenever I came across an article or piece of writing I found insightful, I would copy the entire text and paste it inside Roam, with an appropriate title and timestamp as shown below.  
一开始，我将 Roam 用作信息倾倒场。每当我遇到一篇我认为有见地的文章或文章时，我都会复制整个文本并将其粘贴到 Roam 中，并附上适当的标题和时间戳，如下所示。

_Figure: A note captured on February 21st, 2020, at 4:57 PM.

Except… the inefficiency of this approach was soon apparent.  
除了…… 这种方法的低效很快就显现出来了。

**_What was the point of capturing and dumping information if it was never to be looked at?  
如果信息永远不会被查看，那么捕获和转储信息有什么意义呢？_**

That’s when I began thinking about an effective way to capture _ideas_ — as opposed to just _information_ — and building a framework to produce _new_ ideas from those captured.  
就在那时，我开始考虑一种有效的方法来捕捉想法——而不仅仅是信息——并建立一个框架来从捕捉到的想法中产生新的想法。

**In this article, I describe the simple framework I use to capture ideas effectively and cross-pollinate them, so they lead to new insights.  
在这篇文章中，我描述了一个简单的框架，我用它来有效地捕捉想法并交叉授粉，从而产生新的见解。**

**The Mind Garden Framework 心灵花园框架**
------------------------------------

There is something about gardens and nature… that draws me in. Perhaps it spurs from spending almost every evening of my 2019 and 2020 in a park, surrounded by trees with a book in hand. Whatever the reason, I am grateful for it.  
有一些关于花园和自然的东西…… 吸引了我。也许是因为我在 2019 年和 2020 年几乎每个晚上都在公园里度过，手捧一本书，周围环绕着树木。不管是什么原因，我都很感激。

**The Mind Garden framework draws a parallel between the evolution of an** **_idea_** **and the evolution of a** **_tree_** **with the following analogies,**  
Mind Garden 框架通过以下类比将一个想法的演变与一棵树的演变相提并论，

*   A **seed** equals a **source of information**, in the form of an article, video, book, podcast, or even just a conversation with a friend.  
    种子等于信息来源，其形式可以是文章、视频、书籍、播客，甚至可以是与朋友的对话。
*   A **leaf** equals **extracting insights from a source of information**, in the form of extracting highlights of an article, video, book, podcast, or conversation, and writing it in your own words.  
    一片叶子等于从信息源中提取见解，形式是提取文章、视频、书籍、播客或对话的要点，然后用您自己的话写出来。
*   A **seedling** equals **building a new insight from existing insights**, by spotting a connection between two leaves.  
    通过发现两片叶子之间的联系，一棵幼苗等于从现有见解中建立新见解。
*   A **plant** equals **aggregating insights to form a well-researched idea**, by connecting seedlings with leaves and seeds. The output of a plant is generally an article or long-form essay.  
    通过将幼苗与叶子和种子联系起来，一株植物等于汇总见解以形成经过充分研究的想法。植物的输出通常是一篇文章或长篇论文。
*   A **tree** equals **an entirely new body of work filled with ideas**, which could be in the form of a book, course, thesis, and more. Trees take years to be nurtured in the mind garden.  
    一棵树相当于一个充满创意的全新工作体系，可以是书籍、课程、论文等形式。心灵花园中的树木需要数年时间才能培育出来。

### **Implementing The Mind Garden Framework on Roam Research  
在漫游研究中实施思维花园框架**

I implement the _Mind Garden_ framework in a simple way in Roam: Adding Metadata. Every note I create in Roam has _metadata_ on top that describes what the page is about when it was created, and what topics it falls under. Below are examples of seed, leaf, seedling, and plant from my Roam workspace. This **seed** is an article I read on the introduction to DAOs. The content you see there is a copy and paste of the entire article. Please observe the metadata of how I have formatted a seed.  
我在 Roam: Adding Metadata 中以简单的方式实现了 Mind Garden 框架。我在 Roam 中创建的每条笔记顶部都有元数据，描述页面创建时的内容，以及它所属的主题。以下是我的漫游工作区中的种子、叶子、幼苗和植物的示例。这个种子是我读到的一篇介绍 DAO 的文章。你看到的内容是整篇文章的复制粘贴。请观察我如何格式化种子的元数据。

![](https://i0.wp.com/curiousmaverick.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/xzZkazUYZE.48.51-PM.png?resize=400%2C290&ssl=1)

The picture shown below is a **leaf** that contains the highlights I took from watching a video on storytelling by Andrew Stanton. The content mentioned in the leaf is my own interpretation from watching the video, rather than the exact transcription of the video.  
下面显示的图片是一张叶子，其中包含我从安德鲁 · 斯坦顿 (Andrew Stanton) 讲故事的视频中摘取的精彩片段。叶子中提到的内容是我自己观看视频的解释，而不是视频的准确转录。

The following **seedling** contains my thoughts _after_ reading an article on MasterClass. The content is written is not from the article, but rather my take on the issues with MasterClass.  
下面的小苗包含了我读了一篇关于 MasterClass 的文章后的感悟。所写的内容不是来自文章，而是我对 MasterClass 问题的看法。

Finally, this **plant** is an article I published based on months of ideation and research. So far, I’ve been treating every article I publish to be a plant.  
最后，这篇植物是我基于数月的构思和研究发表的文章。到目前为止，我一直把我发表的每一篇文章都当成一株植物。

![](https://i0.wp.com/curiousmaverick.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/8L57NTg3eS.28.43-PM.png?resize=400%2C270&ssl=1)

To make my job simpler, I have a page called _Metadata_ with pre-created tags so I only need to copy and paste them when I create a new note.  
为了简化我的工作，我有一个名为元数据的页面，其中包含预先创建的标签，因此我只需要在创建新笔记时复制并粘贴它们。

**Connecting Ideas on Roam Research  
连接关于漫游研究的想法**
---------------------------------------------------

A reason why Roam generated a cult following was because of its lack of structure. Unlike Evernote or OneNote or Google Docs, a new page in Roam does not fall under a _folder_ or _category._ It is free to _roam_ (pun intended) the Roam workspace, akin to a neuron in our brain. But unlike a neuron in our brain, you have to do the work of _connecting_ pages in Roam. I have demonstrated how to connect pages in the following text.  
漫游产生狂热追随者的一个原因是因为它缺乏结构。与 Evernote、OneNote 或 Google Docs 不同，Roam 中的新页面不属于文件夹或类别。它可以自由漫游（双关语）漫游工作区，类似于我们大脑中的神经元。但与我们大脑中的神经元不同，您必须在 Roam 中完成连接页面的工作。我在下文中演示了如何连接页面。

**There are two ways you can** **_connect_** **pages in your Roam workspace,**  
您可以通过两种方式连接漫游工作区中的页面，

*   **Mentioning one page inside the other:** This is the straightforward way. You can mention one page inside another via the “[[]]” command or the “#” command. Below is an example where I’ve mentioned the page “Adora Cheung” inside the note and other pages next to the “Source” tag. All this was done manually.  
    在另一页中提到一页：这是最简单的方法。您可以通过 “[[]]” 命令或 “#” 命令在另一页中提及另一页。下面是一个例子，我在笔记中提到了页面 “Adora Cheung”，在“Source” 标签旁边提到了其他页面。所有这些都是手动完成的。

![](https://i0.wp.com/curiousmaverick.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/g24oLPorTe.01.32-PM-1.png?resize=400%2C160&ssl=1)

*   **Adding tags:** I know you’re already thinking… _but I thought the point of Roam was no tags?_ Sadly, I tried that early on but all it lead to was a dump of information were finding an idea was akin to a needle in a haystack. To me, adding tags helps connect ideas from disparate topics. As one example, if I wanted to take a look at _all_ of my leaves that fall under the “happiness” tag, the following show up. If I were to ever write about happiness, I already have 7 ideas thoughtfully captured from various topics.  
    添加标签：我知道你已经在想...... 但我认为漫游的重点是没有标签？可悲的是，我很早就尝试过，但它导致的只是一堆信息，发现一个想法类似于大海捞针。对我来说，添加标签有助于将不同主题的想法联系起来。举个例子，如果我想看看我所有属于 “幸福” 标签的叶子，就会出现以下内容。如果我要写关于幸福的文章，我已经从各种主题中深思熟虑地收集了 7 个想法。

Some of the basic yet seemingly irreplaceable inventions such as suitcases with wheels, toaster ovens, and alarm clocks were a result of people seeing connections and patterns that no one else saw. Even the printing press came into existence when Johannes Gutenberg combined the flexibility of a coin punch with the power of a wine press.  
一些基本但看似不可替代的发明，例如带轮子的手提箱、烤箱和闹钟，是人们看到其他人看不到的联系和模式的结果。当约翰内斯 · 古腾堡 (Johannes Gutenberg) 将硬币冲压机的灵活性与葡萄酒压榨机的强大功能结合起来时，甚至印刷机也应运而生。

Sam Hinkie, the General Manager of NBA’s 76ers, and one of the greater thinkers of our time wrote the following in his resignation letter,  
NBA 76 人队总经理萨姆 · 辛基 (Sam Hinkie) 是我们这个时代最伟大的思想家之一，他在辞职信中写道：

> _“Whenever possible, I think cross-pollinating ideas from other contexts is far, far better than attempting to solve our problems in basketball as if no one has ever faced anything similar. Accordingly, this approach comes from a frequent search into behavioural economics, cognitive science, and a lot of observation and trial and error over my 11 years in the NBA. And mistakes. Lots and lots of mistakes.”  
> “只要有可能，我认为来自其他背景的交叉授粉想法远比试图解决我们在篮球中的问题要好得多，就好像没有人遇到过类似的事情一样。因此，这种方法来自对行为经济学、认知科学的频繁探索，以及我在 NBA 11 年中的大量观察和反复试验。和错误。错误很多很多。”_

Roam, and the framework I built on top, gives me a chance to make this cross-pollination simple. Almost too simple.  
Roam 和我在其上构建的框架让我有机会简化这种异花授粉。几乎太简单了。

**Power of Idea Capture & Niklas Luhmann  
创意捕捉的力量 & 尼克拉斯 · 卢曼**
----------------------------------------------------------------

There was a german sociologist by the name of [Niklas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas_Luhmann) Luhmann in the 1900s who, in his lifetime, published 50 books and 600 scholarly articles on a variety of subjects including the economy, politics, art, religion, ecology, and mass media. Many of his works became classics in their respective fields and over half a dozen books were published _after_ his death based on almost finished manuscripts lying around in his office.  
1900 年代有一位名叫尼克拉斯 · 卢曼 (Niklas Luhmann) 的德国社会学家，他一生出版了 50 本书和 600 篇学术文章，涉及经济、政治、艺术、宗教、生态和大众传媒等多个学科。他的许多作品都成为了各自领域的经典之作，在他死后，根据他办公室里几近完成的手稿，出版了六多本书。

**_How was he able to create so much in just a matter of 50 years?  
他怎么能在短短 50 年的时间里创造出如此多的东西？_**

The answer might seem too simple to be true (although it is!).  
答案可能看起来太简单而不真实（尽管它是！）。

#### It was through taking down ideas on small index cards. That’s all.  
这是通过在小索引卡上记下想法。就这样。

For a while, Luhmann took notes the way most people did back then, and probably even now: commenting in the margins of a textbook or creating handwritten notes by topic. However, soon, he realized that this did not lead to any new insight.  
有一段时间，Luhmann 做笔记的方式与当时大多数人的方式相同，甚至现在可能也是如此：在教科书的空白处发表评论或按主题创建手写笔记。然而，很快，他发现这并没有带来任何新的领悟。

So he built his own system and termed it the [Zettelkasten,](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/) which is german for “slip-box.” Any time he had an idea while reading something, he would create two index cards:  
因此，他建立了自己的系统并将其命名为 Zettelkasten，在德语中是 “滑箱” 的意思。每当他在阅读某物时有一个想法，他都会制作两张索引卡：

*   One index card containing the bibliographical information such as the title of the book and page number to reference, and  
    一张索引卡，包含书目信息，例如书名和页码以供参考，以及
*   A second index card containing his thoughts on what he read and how they relate to his work and perhaps to another card in his slip box.  
    第二张索引卡包含他对所读内容的想法以及这些想法与他的工作以及可能与他的便条盒中的另一张卡片的关系。

In his lifetime, he created more than 90,000 index cards. That might seem like a lot, but if you break it down over the 50 years when he was prolific, it comes down to 5 cards a day. A number that most of us are more than capable of achieving.  
在他的一生中，他制作了 90,000 多张索引卡。这可能看起来很多，但如果你将其分解为他多产的 50 年，它可以归结为每天 5 张卡片。我们大多数人都能够实现的数字。

**However, the goal of the Zettelkasten is not a** **_collection._** **Instead, it is** **_connection._**  
然而，Zettelkasten 的目标不是收藏。相反，它是连接。

One hundred cards that are richly connected to each other are better than 1,000 cards that do not communicate.  
一百张相互联系丰富的卡片好过 1000 张互不联系的卡片。

**Closing Thoughts 结束语**
------------------------

Writing this article took me less than two hours.  
写这篇文章花了我不到两个小时。

Because I had already accumulated the ideas that went into it over the past two years, and all I had to do was peer into my second brain to connect the insights together.  
因为我已经积累了过去两年的想法，我所要做的就是凝视我的第二个大脑，将这些见解联系在一起。

_This_ is the power of effective idea capture and connection.  
这就是有效的想法捕捉和联系的力量。

You have brilliant ideas every day. You owe it to yourself to capture some of them.  
你每天都有绝妙的点子。你应该为自己捕捉其中的一些。

Perhaps you can begin with the ideas you had from reading this article?  
也许您可以从阅读本文时的想法开始？
