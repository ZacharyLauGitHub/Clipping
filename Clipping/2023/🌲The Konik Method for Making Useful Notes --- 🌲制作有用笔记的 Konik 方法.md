Once upon a time, I shared a rough sketch of what my process for active and passive research looked like. It looked something like this:  
曾几何时，我分享了我的主动和被动研究过程的粗略草图。它看起来像这样：

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image.png)

This is more-or-less accurate despite being six months old and my job changing twice in the meantime, which speaks well for its stability.   
这或多或少是准确的，尽管我已经六个月了，同时我的工作换了两次，这很好地说明了它的稳定性。

But I never had a chance to write out an explanation of how these pieces fit together... until this week. Doing so made me realize that it's a lot more straightforward to explain if I omit the tools and focus on the process:  
但我从来没有机会写出这些部分如何组合在一起的解释......直到本周。这样做让我意识到，如果我省略工具并专注于过程，那么解释起来要简单得多：

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-14.png)

A picture is _actually_ worth 7,000 words, it turns out.   
事实证明，一张图片实际上值 7,000 个字。

Of course, everybody always asks what tools and philosophies and methods I use to accomplish this relatively straightforward process of making and using useful notes, so here's my best attempt to write it all down.  
当然，每个人总是问我使用什么工具、哲学和方法来完成这个制作和使用有用笔记的相对简单的过程，所以我最好尝试把它全部写下来。

This is not intended to be a guide to "doing things my way" so much as an attempt to explain how and I why I do things, in hopes that seeing the metacognition behind the workflow helps at least one person improve their life in some small way.  
这并不是要成为“按我的方式做事”的指南，而是试图解释我如何做事以及我为什么做事，希望看到工作流程背后的元认知至少能帮助一个人在一些小的方面改善他们的生活方式。

## Motivations: Start with the WHY 动机：从为什么开始

I generally come at the process of note making from one of three angles. They represented on the chart above as "ebooks," "I have a question" and "passive feeds" although in retrospect I should have said "hobby reading" instead of "ebook" there.  
我通常从三个角度中的一个来看待做笔记的过程。它们在上面的图表中表示为“电子书”、“我有一个问题”和“被动反馈”，尽管现在回想起来我应该说“爱好阅读”而不是“电子书”。

### Pleasure Reading 乐读

The latter is the least common, but easiest to explain: sometimes I see a big book on an interesting topic and either buy it or put it on my wishlist, and then when I've got a lot of downtime and nothing better to do, or am particularly interested in it, I read it cover-to-cover. I highlight the interesting bits when they strike me, but I'm not reading for a purpose; I'm reading for pleasure.  
后者是最不常见的，但最容易解释：有时我看到一本关于有趣主题的大书，要么买下它，要么把它放在我的愿望清单上，然后当我有很多停机时间而没有更好的事情要做时，或者对它特别感兴趣，我就从头到尾读了一遍。当它们打动我时，我会突出显示有趣的部分，但我不是为了某个目的而阅读；我读书是为了快乐。

It's sort of the middle of the road option that used to be mostly how I engaged with note making; highlighting and annotating a dead tree book on a topic of interest, and then moving on with my life once I was done, richer in knowledge but not particularly prone to remembering or using the information gained. It was a hobby, not meant to be productive, and I still do it sometimes.  
这是一种中间选择，过去主要是我从事笔记制作的方式；在一本关于感兴趣的主题的死树书上突出显示和注释，然后在完成后继续我的生活，知识更丰富但不是特别容易记住或使用所获得的信息。这是一种爱好，并不是为了提高效率，但我有时仍然会这样做。

### Problem Solving 解决问题

The next most common reason I approach information to make notes about is that I need to solve a problem. Sometimes the problem is "I need to decide on an email app" or "I want to build my dream house" or "how can I keep track of all the important things that happen with my kid?" – sometimes it's "I keep getting SEO hits for the Dark Smith of Drontheim even though it's only a casual mention from a six year old article about [modern folklore like road gators](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/modern-folklore/), I should learn more about the dark smith so I can hit that SEO niche better."  
我处理信息以做笔记的下一个最常见原因是我需要解决问题。有时问题是“我需要决定使用电子邮件应用程序”或“我想建造我梦想中的房子”或“我怎样才能跟踪我孩子发生的所有重要事情？” – 有时是“我一直在为 Drontheim 的 Dark Smith 获得 SEO 命中，尽管这只是一篇六年前关于现代民间传说（如公路鳄鱼）的文章中的一个偶然提及，我应该了解更多关于 Dark Smith 的信息，这样我就可以进入那个 SEO 利基市场更好的。”

Research topics like the latter typically send me into PDF collection mode. I don't do much with PDFs _currently_ because of time constraints, but [the reference manager Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is still the best method I've found for this. The [Zotero integration](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-zotero-integration) plugin for Obsidian is really solid, although things were a bit dicey with Zotero/Obsidian during the big Zotero upgrade from version 5 to version 6. That said, I'm hopeful that by the time I have enough free time to do heavy research again, Readwise will have brought its reference management & PDF reading / annotating experience up to par with Zotero's, because Readwise's extraction process is a lot more pleasant and automated.  
像后者这样的研究主题通常会让我进入 PDF 收集模式。由于时间限制，我目前对 PDF 的处理不多，但参考管理器 Zotero 仍然是我找到的最好的方法。 Obsidian 的 Zotero 集成插件非常可靠，尽管在 Zotero 从第 5 版到第 6 版的大升级期间，Zotero/Obsidian 有点冒险。也就是说，我希望到时候我有足够的空闲时间去做再次进行大量研究，Readwise 将其参考管理和 PDF 阅读/注释体验提升到与 Zotero 相媲美的水平，因为 Readwise 的提取过程更加愉快和自动化。

👩💼

In the interests of ethics I should note that I will be starting [a job](https://readwise.notion.site/Quality-Assurance-Specialist-0f33e9de7c2f40199785b823f7d8c47e) with [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/ac9) soon, but that's not why I wrote this.   
出于道德的考虑，我应该指出，我将很快开始在 Readwise 工作，但这不是我写这篇文章的原因。

Realistically, these sorts of notes are often less about complex workflows and academic deep dives than making sure I have the results of a casual search or conversation ready to hand the next time the subject comes up. Many of my notes involve remarkably little "research" - I record milestones and meeting notes, information about books I'm interested in, links to vacation homes that might work out for different trips I'd like to take, photos of nifty kitchen mosaics and bathroom fixtures, records of how my tomatoes did in a particular spot, epiphanies about why particular television shows were great and how I can apply those lessons to my own fiction writing, etc.  
实际上，这些类型的笔记通常不是关于复杂的工作流程和学术深入研究，而是确保我在下次主题出现时准备好随意搜索或对话的结果。我的许多笔记涉及的“研究”非常少——我记录里程碑和会议记录、我感兴趣的书籍的信息、可能适合我想进行的不同旅行的度假屋的链接、漂亮的厨房马赛克照片和浴室设施，我的西红柿在特定地点的表现记录，关于为什么特定电视节目很棒以及我如何将这些课程应用到我自己的小说写作中的顿悟，等等。

It's not quite journaling, but it _is_ in line with the idea that in order to think clearly you must express your thoughts. Some people say you need to _write_ in order to effectively think, but I don't think that's true - talking things out with friends and family seems to work just fine for a lot of people.  
这不完全是日记，但它符合这样的想法，即为了清晰地思考，你必须表达你的想法。有人说你需要写作才能有效思考，但我认为那不是真的——与朋友和家人谈论事情似乎对很多人来说都很好。

Nobody ever says [rubber ducky debugging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) involves writing memos to your preferred duck, after all.  
毕竟，从来没有人说过橡皮鸭调试涉及为你喜欢的鸭子写备忘录。

Everybody uses different vocabulary, but this is what I like to call _active note making_ because it's the sort of thing I do when I have a specific goal I am working toward. I do this when I have specifically allotted time for it. Emotionally, it feels a bit like questing, which is I suppose just another metaphor explaining how [Obsidian helped me quit video games](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/obsidian-replaced-games-now-prolific/) (not that I was trying to!).  
每个人都使用不同的词汇，但这就是我喜欢称之为主动做笔记的东西，因为当我有一个特定的目标时，我就会这样做。当我专门为它分配时间时，我会这样做。在情感上，这感觉有点像探索，我想这只是解释黑曜石如何帮助我戒掉电子游戏的另一个比喻（不是我试图戒掉的！）。

### Pursuing Serendipity  追求机缘巧合

Most of what I learn comes to me not so much "by accident" or "unintentionally" as _reactively._ People usually use 'active vs passive' in a notetaking context as a proxy for how thoroughly you are _engaging_ with a source - whether you're thinking independent thoughts or just absorbing the information by rote. But since I pretty much never do the latter (even when teachers wished I would!) I've chosen to repurpose the dichotomy. For me, "reactive" note making happens when I am basically killing time.  
我所学到的大部分知识与其说是“偶然”或“无意”，不如说是被动的。人们通常在记笔记的情况下使用“主动与被动”来表示您与来源接触的程度——无论您是独立思考还是只是死记硬背地吸收信息。但由于我几乎从不做后者（即使老师希望我这样做！）我选择重新调整二分法。对我来说，“反应性”笔记制作发生在我基本上是在消磨时间的时候。

If I'm making my way across a long parking lot on my way to pick my son up from daycare, I'll sort my RSS feeds. If I'm waiting by myself at the doctor's office, I'll read an article or two from my queue. If my kid or I are sick and he wants to learn about racoons, we'll put on a documentary. I try to only check Twitter when I'm away from my desk, making tea or whatnot.  
如果我在去托儿所接儿子的路上穿过一个长长的停车场，我会整理我的 RSS 提要。如果我一个人在医生办公室等候，我会阅读队列中的一两篇文章。如果我的孩子或我生病了，他想了解浣熊，我们会放一部纪录片。我尽量只在离开办公桌、泡茶或做其他事情的时候查看 Twitter。

#### With Videos 有影片

I almost never do "dedicated notetaking" when I'm watching videos. I haven't taken anything that feels like college lecture notes in years; I don't particularly enjoy audiovisual content for its own sake, so I usually take a "get in and get out" approach where I'm looking for one specific thing that _has_ to be conveyed visually to be maximally effective, like [how to effectively skin and butcher a crocodile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLaXcxE5spI)... which was remarkably useful when I was writing a scene about a character who was unexpectedly stuck dealing with a wyvern corpse in the middle of a desert.  
当我看视频时，我几乎从不做“专门的笔记”。多年来，我没有听过任何感觉像大学讲义的东西；我不是特别喜欢视听内容本身，所以我通常采用“进进出出”的方法，在这种方法中，我正在寻找必须通过视觉传达才能发挥最大效果的特定事物，比如如何有效地皮肤和屠夫鳄鱼......当我写一个关于一个角色意外地被困在沙漠中间处理飞龙尸体的场景时，这非常有用。

Generally, I either need to "bookmark" the video where I can find it again when I need it (I linked to the video above in a hidden comment on the scene I wrote), or take one or two quick notes about one or two obscure tidbits I picked up.  
通常，我要么需要将视频“添加书签”，以便在需要时可以再次找到它（我在我写的场景的隐藏评论中链接到上面的视频），要么就一两个快速做笔记我捡到的晦涩花絮。

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-1.png)

I am not particularly strict about how I organize these. The point is to be able to find them again, which I can whether it's noted in the source or as a more detailed claim.  
我对如何组织这些并不是特别严格。关键是能够再次找到它们，无论是在源代码中注明还是作为更详细的声明，我都可以找到。

On the rare occasions I _do_ find myself taking notes longer than this, I do it the same way I take notes in meetings.  
在极少数情况下，我确实发现自己做笔记的时间比这更长，我的做法与我在会议上做笔记的方式相同。

#### With People 与人

Sometimes I attend lectures where there's a lot of useful information being conveyed. Generally the ones I like best are put on by academics over Zoom about something in their area of expertise. Josephine Quinn had a nice one about the historicity of Dido, and I particularly enjoyed Troels Pank Arbøll's lecture about epidemic diseases in ancient Mesopotamia.  
有时我会去听讲座，那里会传达很多有用的信息。一般来说，我最喜欢的是学者们通过 Zoom 发布的关于他们专业领域的内容。约瑟芬·奎因 (Josephine Quinn) 对黛朵的历史性有一个很好的描述，我特别喜欢特鲁尔斯·潘克·阿尔布尔 (Troels Pank Arbøll) 关于古代美索不达米亚流行病的演讲。

A lot of people take notes like this outliner style, with bullet points, but I really prefer using headers and paragraphs, although I do sometimes use bullet points.  
很多人都喜欢用大纲样式做笔记，但我真的更喜欢使用标题和段落，尽管我有时会使用项目符号。

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-2.png)

The main thing I want to emphasize is that I don't have a strict template, and that my notes are very messy.  
主要想强调的是，我没有严格的模板，而且我的笔记很乱。

My one big problem with taking notes in this style is that historically I've liked to include images of relevant lecture slides in my notes, but Android tends to eat them during its "clean up" processes, and I always have the devil of a time recovering those images. They're somewhere in my backups, but my notes are usually good enough without them. Still, I show you this as a two-fold warning: one, that my methods are not clean and perfect and shiny, and two – technology is never as reliable as we want it to be. I'm confident I could recover those missing "pasted images" if I needed to, but I'm also friends with professional computer forensics experts. If you're not _that_ confident, I recommend triple-checking to make sure that your devices don't helpfully save space by moving your images for you...  
我用这种方式做笔记的一个大问题是，过去我喜欢在我的笔记中包含相关讲座幻灯片的图像，但 Android 往往会在其“清理”过程中吃掉它们，而且我总是有一个魔鬼恢复这些图像的时间。它们在我的备份中的某个地方，但没有它们，我的笔记通常也足够好。不过，我向您展示这是一个双重警告：一是我的方法不干净、完美和闪亮，二是技术永远不会像我们希望的那样可靠。如果需要，我相信我可以恢复那些丢失的“粘贴图像”，但我也是专业计算机取证专家的朋友。如果您不是那么自信，我建议您进行三次检查，以确保您的设备不会通过为您移动图像来帮助节省空间……

But I personally haven't bothered because like I said, I don't attend many lectures.  
但我个人并没有费心，因为正如我所说，我参加的讲座不多。

Mostly, notes that come from people are things I jot down during meetings (where I almost always do use bullet points, although I don't bother with anything more fancy than a quick `#priority` if there's something important I need to do) and almost always refactor later by moving key information into the relevant places, like my email, calendar, or reference notes.  
大多数情况下，来自人们的笔记是我在会议期间记下的东西（我几乎总是使用要点，尽管如果有重要的事情我需要做的话，除了快速的 `#priority` 之外我不会理会任何更花哨的事情）和几乎总是在以后通过将关键信息移动到相关位置（例如我的电子邮件、日历或参考笔记）来进行重构。

For example, while meeting some of my new coworkers, I was having a casual conversation about roses and learned that [roses are often grown in vineyards](https://homeguides.sfgate.com/planting-rose-bushes-grape-vines-29763.html) because they function as "[canaries in the coal mine](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/canary_in_a_coal_mine)" for grapes, in that they are more persnickety to grow and keep healthy but otherwise like similar conditions. This was neat! I wrote it down — on paper, because I hate typing during a meeting, because it's so loud. But then I typed up my handwritten notes so I'd have them somewhere they'll show up on search for the moment when I remember my coworker told me something cool but can't remember what it was, which is a terrible feeling.  
例如，在认识一些新同事时，我在闲聊玫瑰时了解到，玫瑰通常种植在葡萄园中，因为它们对葡萄来说就像是“煤矿里的金丝雀”，比较挑剔。并保持健康，但在其他方面与类似情况类似。这很整洁！我把它写下来了——写在纸上，因为我讨厌在会议期间打字，因为它太吵了。但后来我把我的手写笔记打出来，这样我就可以把它们放在某个地方，当我想起我的同事告诉我一些很酷但不记得是什么的时候，它们会出现在搜索中，这是一种可怕的感觉。

#### With Written Content  有书面内容

One of the most popular uses for [Readwise](https://readwise.io/i/ac9) is to save insightful tweets into a repository of notes for later perusal. The little `@readwise save` message is great advertising for Readwise, and it's a great way to turn Twitter threads into the articles they yearn to be. But I live to rebel against the normal ways of doing things in personal knowledge management circles, so mostly I bookmark information using Twitter bookmarks and then once a week review stuff I found to see if I can find better sources for whatever factoid caught my attention.  
Readwise 最流行的用途之一是将有见地的推文保存到笔记库中，以供日后细读。小小的 `@readwise save` 消息是 Readwise 的绝佳广告，也是将 Twitter 帖子变成他们渴望成为的文章的好方法。但我生活在反抗个人知识管理圈子中做事的正常方式，所以大部分时间我使用 Twitter 书签为信息添加书签，然后每周回顾一次我发现的东西，看看我是否能找到更好的资源来吸引我的注意力。

I almost never save advice or motivational statements; I absorb them or forget them. My notes are intended for things I need to _reference,_ not for self-improvement. Others will vary on that, but it's a philosophy that informs a lot of what I do, so I figured I should mention it.  
我几乎从不保存建议或动机陈述；我吸收它们或忘记它们。我的笔记是为了我需要参考的东西，而不是为了自我提升。其他人对此会有不同的看法，但这是一种哲学，它告诉我很多我所做的事情，所以我想我应该提一下。

Anyway, while Readwise is nominally a spaced repetition app that also functions as a bridge between highlights / annotations and note taking apps, they're building [a read it later app called Reader](https://readwise.io/read) that works really well for highlighting and annotating newsletters and articles (including press releases, blog posts, and twitter threads that are basically articles). It even does a credible job with discussion threads like on forums and Reddit.  
不管怎样，虽然 Readwise 名义上是一个间隔重复应用程序，也充当高亮/注释和笔记应用程序之间的桥梁，但他们正在构建一个名为 Reader 的稍后阅读应用程序，它非常适合突出显示和注释新闻通讯和文章（包括新闻发布、博客文章和 Twitter 线程，它们基本上都是文章）。它甚至在论坛和 Reddit 等讨论线程上也做得很好。

Most of the value I get out of Readwise is as a way to curate opportunities for myself. I wrote an article about this recently...  
我从 Readwise 中获得的大部分价值是作为一种为自己策划机会的方式。我最近写了一篇关于这个的文章......

[

🌲 Using RSS to curate opportunities  
🌲 使用 RSS 策划机会

I divide my RSS feed according to how I can interact with the articles, how far along I am with processing the information, and how I think I can use them later.  
我根据与文章的交互方式、处理信息的进度以及我认为以后可以如何使用它们来划分 RSS 提要。

](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/using-rss-to-curate-opportunities/)

...so I don't want to repeat myself too much, but big takeaway is that I divide my RSS feed according to how I can interact with the articles, how far along I am with processing the information, and how I think I can use them later. But fundamentally these feeds are sources that I "set and forget" in terms of them being selected for having a high signal to noise ratio, which means it's likely I'll find something worth reading whenever an article is "pushed" to me, even though I haven't personally selected it.  
...所以我不想重复太多，但重要的是，我根据与文章的互动方式、处理信息的进度以及我的想法来划分 RSS 提要以后可以使用它们。但从根本上说，这些提要是我“设置并忘记”的来源，因为它们被选择为具有高信噪比，这意味着每当有文章“推送”给我时，我很可能会发现一些值得阅读的东西，即使虽然我没有亲自选择它。

## Methods: How To Record Information In Useful Ways  
方法：如何以有用的方式记录信息

Of course, having a reason to make notes is only the first step. Once I have stuff (ideas, links, information, evidence) I want to record, I need to actually put it somewhere I can find it again. Once again, I have two primary methods for this: direct and automated.  
当然，有理由做笔记只是第一步。一旦我有了想要记录的东西（想法、链接、信息、证据），我就需要把它放在我能再次找到的地方。再一次，我有两种主要方法：直接和自动。

The direct method is very straightforward, the digital equivalent of sitting in my office with a textbook in my lap and a notebook on my desk, hand-writing notes on index cards as I go. The automated method is the equivalent of highlighting and scribbling notes in a book I own and then handing it off to a research assistant, who returns a week later with a big binder full of neatly organized notes based on my commentary... and someone else's paradigm and preferences for organization,  because no matter how clear I make my directions, my assistant isn't literally me.  
直接法非常简单，相当于坐在办公室里，膝上放着教科书，桌上放着笔记本，边走边在索引卡上手写笔记。自动化方法相当于在我拥有的一本书中突出显示和涂鸦笔记，然后将其交给研究助理，一周后他会带着一个大活页夹回来，里面装满了根据我的评论……和其他人的评论整理得井井有条的笔记组织的范例和偏好，因为无论我的指示多么清晰，我的助手都不是真正的我。

There are pros and cons to each method; the direct method is faster and I retain more of the information I interact because I interact with it for longer. The automated method is more efficient from an effort perspective but takes longer to achieve and requires me to interface with how someone else's brain works.  
每种方法都有利有弊。直接法更快，而且我保留了更多我交互的信息，因为我与它交互的时间更长。从努力的角度来看，自动化方法更有效，但需要更长的时间才能实现，并且需要我与其他人的大脑工作方式进行交互。

### Making Notes Directly 直接做笔记

First, a caveat. Some people like to integrate their highlighting and annotating tools into their notetaking app. Obsidian has the annotator plugin, Logseq has a direct bridge to Zotero, and I'm sure other tools use other methods to facilitate this. As I've explained on Twitter in the past, [I avoid annotating directly from my note-taking app.](https://twitter.com/monicarysavy/status/1487774253218938882) I strongly prefer to use a dedicated reference manager, a dedicated PDF reader and to store PDFs in a dedicated folder. Although Obsidian now supports multiple windows – which allows me to optimally use multiple screens – it doesn't feel as robust and future-proof as using a purpose-built app.  
首先，一个警告。有些人喜欢将他们的突出显示和注释工具集成到他们的笔记应用程序中。 Obsidian 有注释器插件，Logseq 有一个直接连接到 Zotero 的桥梁，我相信其他工具使用其他方法来促进这一点。正如我过去在 Twitter 上解释的那样，我避免直接从我的笔记应用程序中进行注释。我非常喜欢使用专用的参考资料管理器、专用的 PDF 阅读器并将 PDF 存储在专用文件夹中。尽管 Obsidian 现在支持多个窗口——这让我可以最佳地使用多个屏幕——但它并不像使用专门构建的应用程序那样稳健和面向未来。

Typically, when I'm taking notes directly, I've got my browser open on my left-hand screen and my notes open on the right-hand screen. Maybe I'm looking for the answer to a question, maybe I'm just stumbling across something cool on Twitter, but if I stumble across a useful piece of information through one of my sources above, there are basically three things I can do with it:  
通常，当我直接做笔记时，我会在左侧屏幕上打开浏览器，在右侧屏幕上打开我的笔记。也许我正在寻找问题的答案，也许我只是在 Twitter 上偶然发现了一些很酷的东西，但是如果我通过上面的一个来源偶然发现了一条有用的信息，基本上我可以做三件事它：

1.  Record it in a pre-existing note,  
    将其记录在预先存在的笔记中，
2.  Create a new note,  创建一个新的笔记，
3.  or send it to Readwise to be dealt with indirectly.  
    或将其发送给 Readwise 以间接处理。

My pre-existing notes come in two primary flavors:  
我已有的笔记有两种主要形式：

-   logs and indexes 日志和索引

##### Logs & Indexes 日志和索引

Logs and indexes, which are basically lists of things like "handy LaTeX guides,"  "scripts I need to access my server," "useful accessibility tools," "travel tips for Harper's Ferry" "books I'd like to read someday" and concept notes like "the Bronze Age" and "Chinese infrastructure" – they're basically places I shove information on a given topic in a moderately haphazard way, on the assumption that when I'm looking for information on Chinese infrastructure or getting ready to visit Harper's Ferry, the information I thought worth saving will be easy to find.  
日志和索引，基本上是诸如“方便的 LaTeX 指南”、“我需要访问我的服务器的脚本”、“有用的辅助工具”、“Harper's Ferry 的旅行提示”“我有朝一日想读的书”之类的列表以及诸如“青铜时代”和“中国基础设施”之类的概念说明——它们基本上是我以适度随意的方式推送有关给定主题的信息的地方，假设当我正在寻找有关中国基础设施的信息或做准备时访问哈珀斯费里，我认为值得保存的信息将很容易找到。

Apologies for the mess, I'm just trying to demonstrate the different ways my logs and indexes can end up looking.  
为混乱道歉，我只是想展示我的日志和索引最终看起来的不同方式。

Incidentally, I do basically everything in [the new default theme by Kepano](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/2022-09-03/) these days. Just about the only CSS I use is to get myself a custom checkbox for `- [b]` bookmark, and I haven't even bothered to fix the weird line in the icon.  
顺便说一句，这些天我基本上都在 Kepano 的新默认主题中做所有事情。我使用的唯一 CSS 是为自己设置一个用于 `- [b]` 书签的自定义复选框，我什至懒得修复图标中的奇怪线条。

##### Claim, Evidence, Explanation  主张、证据、解释

When I teach students how to write a paragraph appropriate for answering a document based question or long essay, the format we use has a bunch of different names and mnemonics depending on teacher preference and district habits. You can "spill the TEA" (topic sentence / evidence / analysis) or make a "PEE chain" (point / evidence / explanation) or "write a CER" (claim / evidence / reasoning).  
当我教学生如何写一段适合回答基于文档的问题或长篇论文时，我们使用的格式有一堆不同的名称和助记符，具体取决于老师的偏好和地区习惯。您可以“spill the TEA”（主题句/证据/分析）或制作“PEE 链”（点/证据/解释）或“写 CER”（声明/证据/推理）。

Although I don't structure my notes as formal paragraphs (...usually), I do find this organizational method surprisingly useful. I've written about [the value of consistent naming conventions](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/consistent-naming/) at length before, but the short version is that for the kinds of notes I'm discussing here, I give them all file names that are claims.  
尽管我没有将笔记组织成正式的段落（……通常），但我确实发现这种组织方法非常有用。我之前已经详细地写过一致命名约定的价值，但简短的版本是，对于我在这里讨论的笔记类型，我给它们所有的文件名都是声明。

The analog metaphor is pretty straightforward. If I were preparing to write a big paper, and was using index cards to help stay organized, I might scribble a quick claim on one side, basically putting the key information into my own words as concisely as possible, and at a size big enough to read comfortably at a glance. Then on the back, I would probably write a note about where I could find the source proving and expanding on that claim – i.e. a call number, title, author's name, page number, etc. Below the citation, I might write a longer explanation of how the information might be useful, along with any ideas about how I could use it. I might give the card a unique identifier, zettelkasten style, since it would be awkward to re-write the entire claim every time I wanted to reference it from another note – analog index cards don't have autocomplete, after all.  
模拟比喻非常简单。如果我准备写一篇大论文，并使用索引卡来帮助保持条理，我可能会在一侧草草写下一个快速声明，基本上将关键信息尽可能简洁地用我自己的话写出来，并且尺寸足够大一目了然地舒适阅读。然后在背面，我可能会写一个注释，说明我在哪里可以找到证明和扩展该声明的来源——即索书号、标题、作者姓名、页码等。在引文下方，我可能会写一个更长的解释这些信息可能有什么用处，以及我如何使用它的任何想法。我可能会给卡片一个唯一的标识符，zettelkasten 风格，因为每次我想从另一个笔记中引用它时重新编写整个声明会很尴尬——毕竟模拟索引卡没有自动完成功能。

Once that's done, I would keep reading and looking for evidence of whatever I was trying to say, and do this many times until I have enough information to string together a decent paper.  
完成后，我会继续阅读并寻找我想说的任何证据，并多次这样做，直到我有足够的信息来拼凑出一篇像样的论文。

Digitally speaking, I do something pretty similar to this. I put my claim as the title of the file, where it's easy to see when "flipping" through all of my notes, similar to how I can only see the front of an index card when flipping through a box of them. Then embed the relevant quote (because I have more space in a digital file than I do on a notecard, and it doesn't take me much time at all to copy the exact verbiage) in a way that provides me with breadcrumbs back to the source so I can provide that source to anyone questioning me, or double check that source if I need more context or stumble across reason to believe my original claim was wrong – either because I misinterpreted the evidence or someone else is able to refute it. The point is to always give myself a way to get back to the original source of my claim, and retain as much evidence as I need to prove my claim correct.  
从数字上讲，我做的事情与此非常相似。我把我的声明作为文件的标题，当“翻阅”我所有的笔记时很容易看到，类似于我在翻阅一盒索引卡时只能看到索引卡的正面。然后嵌入相关的引用（因为我在数字文件中的空间比在记事卡上的空间多，而且我根本不需要太多时间来复制确切的措辞），以一种让我返回面包屑的方式来源，这样我就可以向任何质疑我的人提供该来源，或者如果我需要更多上下文或偶然发现理由相信我最初的主张是错误的，请仔细检查该来源——要么是因为我误解了证据，要么是其他人能够反驳它。关键是要始终给自己一种方法来回到我的主张的原始来源，并保留尽可能多的证据来证明我的主张是正确的。

Lots of people say that you should paraphrase everything, and that the only things in your notes should be things you wrote in your own words. I've spoken about this before, but I think this is not only misguided but dangerous; [attribution is important](https://twitter.com/thenotiongirl/status/1487668189257478145). So is actually engaging with information you're collecting so that you've got half a chance of retaining it and future you knows what the heck you saved it for, but I judge people a lot less for harmless hobbyist collecting of things they will neither understand nor use than I do for attribution errors, personally. Before you repeat a claim, you should at a minimum be in a position to give people access to the primary source so they have a better chance of [evaluating stuff they learn on the internet](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/evaluating-references/). It's an ethics thing. Good for society.  
很多人说你应该解释一切，你的笔记中唯一的东西应该是你用自己的话写的东西。我以前说过这个，但我认为这不仅是错误的，而且是危险的；归因很重要。所以实际上参与你正在收集的信息，这样你就有一半的机会保留它，未来你知道你到底为什么保存它，但我认为人们不会因为无害的爱好者收集他们既不会的东西而判断人们就归因错误而言，我个人理解或使用的比我多。在你重复声明之前，你至少应该能够让人们访问主要来源，这样他们就有更好的机会评估他们在互联网上学到的东西。这是道德问题。对社会有好处。

Anyway, once I'm done recording my evidence and sourcing, I often (but not always - being realistic it's not always necessary, and I try to avoid unnecessary work) explain how I think I can use a particular claim and evidence combo. This is where links to other files come in handy, because then when I'm in the other file, my new note will pop up in the backlinks without me having to physically go to the old file and update it, the way I would need to do on paper (or [a website that doesn't support backlinks, like my other newsletter, the one with all my research and stories](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/eclectic220916/)...)  
不管怎样，一旦我完成了我的证据和来源的记录，我经常（但不总是——现实地说这并不总是必要的，我尽量避免不必要的工作）解释我认为我可以如何使用特定的声明和证据组合。这是指向其他文件的链接派上用场的地方，因为当我在另一个文件中时，我的新笔记将在反向链接中弹出，而无需我亲自去旧文件并更新它，这是我需要的方式在纸上做（或一个不支持反向链接的网站，就像我的其他时事通讯，那个有我所有研究和故事的......）

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-4.png)

I don't have a consistent method for annotating – sometimes I put the note above the quote, other times below. Sometimes I just mark a tag, sometimes I link, sometimes I just write text...  
我没有一个一致的注释方法——有时我把注释放在引语上方，其他时候放在下方。有时我只是标记一个标签，有时我链接，有时我只是写文字......

My general habit  is to use callouts to visually indicate the quote, and in the "title" block give the sourcing information, as much of it as I have. Ideally I include title, author, publication date, publisher / venue, date accessed, and a link, in the following format:  
我的一般习惯是使用标注直观地指示报价，并在“标题”块中提供采购信息，尽可能多。理想情况下，我包括标题、作者、出版日期、出版商/地点、访问日期和链接，格式如下：

```
> [!quote] [Title](link) by [[author]] via [[publication]]. Published on date. Accessed on today.
> Text of the quote.

Brief explanation of why I saved this quote, and any other associated thoughts it gave me about connections, expansions, etc. The annotation, basically. 
```

If you're a daily notes fan, you might link to your daily note directly instead of just giving the numerical date, or you might rely on backlinks. Personally I don't really bother with daily notes. [I prefer themed logs, as I've explained previously](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/themed-logs-not-daily-notes/). Linking to the author and publication is handy, even if I don't have anything else from those sources, because it helps me see which authors and sources I rely on most, and record why I do (or don't!) trust those sources.  
如果您是每日笔记的粉丝，您可能会直接链接到您的每日笔记，而不仅仅是提供数字日期，或者您可能依赖反向链接。就我个人而言，我并不太在意日常笔记。正如我之前解释的那样，我更喜欢主题日志。链接到作者和出版物很方便，即使我没有从这些来源获得任何其他信息，因为它可以帮助我了解我最依赖的作者和来源，并记录我为什么相信（或不相信！）来源。

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-5.png)

Particularly when getting information from Reddit, I like to be careful to make sure I've investigated the source's reliability.   
特别是从 Reddit 获取信息时，我喜欢小心确保我已经调查了来源的可靠性。

Anyway, when I search for all of the notes I have to help me write a newsletter about the history of knives, I'll find my note about how Bronze Age knives had practical purposes. When I'm teaching the Atlantic Slave Trade, and dig through my notes to refresh my memory, I'll find resources about current consensus on early American vulnerability to diseases to help inform my teaching. When I'm working on writing [Civil Mage](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/the-civil-mage-sewers-1/) (the novel I'm currently serializing) I'll be able to easily review all of the notes I thought were relevant to this project; stuff about the Battle of Adrianople, how engineers flatten building sites for long-term stability, the relative rareness of "first contact" events in human history, how siege warfare in the ancient Mediterranean worked, why retaining walls collapse... all notes that could be useful for a story about a Mesopotamian priestess cum public works engineer having to overcome bureaucratic indifference and political cowardice in order to save a society that she wasn't even born into from a genocidal general.  
不管怎样，当我搜索我必须帮助我写一篇关于刀具历史的时事通讯的所有笔记时，我会找到我关于青铜时代刀具如何具有实用目的的笔记。当我教授大西洋奴隶贸易并翻阅我的笔记以刷新我的记忆时，我会找到关于美国早期易患疾病的当前共识的资源，以帮助我的教学。当我在写 Civil Mage（我目前正在连载的小说）时，我将能够轻松地回顾我认为与这个项目相关的所有笔记；关于阿德里安堡战役的内容，工程师如何将建筑工地夷为平地以实现长期稳定，人类历史上“第一次接触”事件相对罕见，古地中海的攻城战如何运作，挡土墙为何倒塌……所有这些都注意到对于一个关于美索不达米亚女祭司兼公共工程工程师必须克服官僚冷漠和政治懦弱以拯救她甚至不是从种族灭绝将军出生的社会的故事。

### Creating Notes Via Automations 通过自动化创建笔记

Most of my note making system is pretty straightforward. The backbone of my work is simple epiphanies like "[if I make a quick outline for an article and then turn all of the bullet points into checkboxes, I can use that as a rubric for writing the longform prose version](https://twitter.com/EleanorKonik/status/1577737164921577473)!" I mostly try to avoid highly technical solutions to problems because they are fragile, unwieldy, difficult to maintain, even more difficult to transfer between computers in a crisis, and even _more_ difficult to adapt to different tools in a worse crisis. [Automation is often more trouble than it's worth](https://xkcd.com/1319/). But often isn't always, and Readwise has been a major component of creating a database of interconnected, vetted information that is at my fingertips whenever I need to sit down and write. [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) and [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) are the two Obsidian plugins that power this workflow, although you could use [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) instead of Quickadd if you wanted, same as you could use Zotero or [Kindle Highlights Plugin](https://github.com/hadynz/obsidian-kindle-plugin) or whatever instead of Readwise. This method isn't really about the specific tool, it's about the format and the habits.  
我的大部分笔记制作系统都非常简单。我工作的主心骨是简单的顿悟，比如“如果我为一篇文章做一个快速大纲，然后把所有的要点变成复选框，我可以用它作为编写长篇散文版本的标题！”我主要尽量避免解决问题的高度技术性解决方案，因为它们脆弱、笨重、难以维护，在危机中更难在计算机之间传输，在更严重的危机中更难以适应不同的工具。自动化往往带来的麻烦大于它的价值。但通常情况并非总是如此，Readwise 一直是创建相互关联的、经过审查的信息数据库的主要组成部分，每当我需要坐下来写作时，这些信息都触手可及。 QuickAdd 和 Dataview 是支持此工作流程的两个 Obsidian 插件，尽管如果你愿意，你可以使用 Templeter 而不是 Quickadd，就像你可以使用 Zotero 或 Kindle Highlights Plugin 或其他任何东西而不是 Readwise 一样。这种方法与具体工具无关，与格式和习惯有关。

#### Readwise 阅读

Step one is to highlight information I want in my notes. The internet is replete with advice about how to know what to highlight, but in my experience, there's no substitute for experience, which is to say metacognition. Highlight stuff, and pay attention to how you feel later. Did it turn out to be useful stuff? Was there too much to be useful? Did you forget stuff? Adapt, iterate, and improve next time. Mistakes are how we learn; the worst thing you can do is nothing, but the second worst thing is to slavishly follow a system you don't understand because you think it's the One True Way. Even if it _is_ the One True Way, it can be worth straying just a little so you can understand how good the path really is. Like playing the field a bit in college so you can better appreciate the person you finally wind up marrying.  
第一步是在笔记中突出显示我想要的信息。互联网上充斥着关于如何知道要突出显示什么的建议，但根据我的经验，没有什么可以替代经验，也就是元认知。突出显示内容，并注意您以后的感受。结果是有用的东西吗？有太多用处吗？你忘记东西了吗？下次调整、迭代和改进。错误是我们学习的方式；你能做的最糟糕的事情是什么都不做，但第二糟糕的事情是盲目地遵循一个你不理解的系统，因为你认为它是唯一正确的方法。即使它是唯一正确的道路，也值得稍微偏离一下，这样你才能了解这条道路到底有多好。就像在大学里玩一点，这样你就可以更好地欣赏你最终结婚的人。

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-7.png)

The "notebook" has all of my highlights and annotations pulled out so I can see "just the important stuff," which is handy. If you want to see the whole article, here's [the public link of my highlights and annotations](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01fthkbpke1bv39cmjc06964fh).  
“notebook”把我所有的高亮显示和注释都拉出来了，所以我可以“只看到重要的东西”，这很方便。如果你想看整篇文章，这里是我的亮点和注释的公共链接。

Since I know this information is going to go to my Obsidian vault as plain text in a text file that Obsidian will read, I tend to write my tags and links directly into the input box.  
因为我知道这些信息将以文本文件中的纯文本形式进入我的 Obsidian 保险库，Obsidian 会读取它，所以我倾向于将我的标签和链接直接写入输入框。

##### Triage

Then step two is figuring out where to direct my attention, and this is where Dataview comes in.  
然后第二步是弄清楚我的注意力在哪里，这就是 Dataview 的用武之地。

```
TABLE file.inlinks AS Inlinks, file.outlinks AS Outlinks, file.tags AS Tags
FROM "10 Pending"
WHERE length(file.inlinks) > 0 OR length(file.outlinks) > 1 Or length(file.tags) > 2
SORT file.size ASC
```

This is a relatively simple query as far as Dataview goes. It creates a chart like the one below, of every file in my "Pending" folder (where the Readwise files go, among others) that is linked _to,_ has links _out,_ and has more than two tags – since all of my Readwise imports have two tags by default, as `#pkm` and `#pkm/process` count as two.  
就 Dataview 而言，这是一个相对简单的查询。它创建了一个如下图所示的图表，包含我的“待定”文件夹（Readwise 文件所在的位置）中的每个链接到的文件，有链接，并且有两个以上的标签——因为我所有的 Readwise 导入默认情况下有两个标签，因为 `#pkm` 和 `#pkm/process` 算作两个。

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-9.png)

Incidentally, automations like the ones supported by Readwise are a big reason why I am and always will be an advocate of folders - it really helps me stay organized and reduce clutter. If I had seen all those wonky imports of Ancient News before now, I would have gotten distracted by them and cleaned them up even though it's not important. But I'm not going to rehash what is literally my most popular article ever; if you want [yet another hot take on folders vs. links](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/yet-another-hot-take-on-folders-versus-tags/), I've got one for you.   
顺便说一句，像 Readwise 支持的自动化是我现在并将永远是文件夹倡导者的一个重要原因 - 它确实帮助我保持井井有条并减少混乱。如果我之前看到所有那些奇怪的 Ancient News 导入，我就会被它们分散注意力并清理它们，即使它们并不重要。但我不会重复我有史以来最受欢迎的文章；如果您还想对文件夹和链接进行另一种热门分析，我为您准备了一个。

I sort them by file size on the rough assumption that a bigger file has more highlights and thus more useful stuff in it. It's easy enough to swap the sorting around, though, by changing the query. For example, here's my list sorted by number of outgoing links:  
我粗略地假设一个更大的文件有更多的亮点，因此里面有更多有用的东西，我按文件大小对它们进行排序。不过，通过更改查询来交换排序非常容易。例如，这是我按传出链接数排序的列表：

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-10.png)

If you don't want to change the query every time you want to re-sort the list, you can also download the [Sortable](https://github.com/alexandru-dinu/obsidian-sortable) plugin, which will let you sort tables a la Wikipedia.  
如果您不想每次对列表重新排序时都更改查询，您还可以下载 Sortable 插件，它可以让您按照维基百科的方式对表格进行排序。

##### Cleanup

Once I've selected an article, I need to fix it up a bit. I'm often in a hurry when I make annotations, and even the best parser misses things sometimes. For convenience's sake, I'll demonstrate by going back to the one about Kashmiri cheese. When I open up the file Readwise created in Obsidian, it looks like this:  
一旦我选择了一篇文章，我需要稍微修改一下。当我做注释时，我经常很匆忙，即使是最好的解析器有时也会遗漏一些东西。为了方便起见，我将通过回到关于克什米尔奶酪的话题来进行演示。当我打开在 Obsidian 中创建的 Readwise 文件时，它看起来像这样：

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/image-8.png)

I achieve this format by using the "Customize formatting options" button in the Readwise plugin to change the template. My settings are here at [this gist](https://gist.github.com/eleanorkonik/1f0586fe13d98f1dbf18ec72b00bf37d), but the main thing is that I really like having the highlight ID number as a unique identifier, because if I accidentally mess up and change the header incorrectly so it doesn't update across all the files I reference, I'll still be able to find it again with a simple search. Having the ID is not particularly useful for finding the highlight in _Readwise,_ but that's why I keep the "View Highlight" link beneath the quote.  
我通过使用 Readwise 插件中的“自定义格式选项”按钮更改模板来实现这种格式。我的设置在这个要点上，但最主要的是我真的很喜欢将突出显示的 ID 号作为唯一标识符，因为如果我不小心弄乱并错误地更改了标题，那么它就不会在我引用的所有文件中更新，我仍然可以通过简单的搜索再次找到它。拥有 ID 对于在 Readwise 中查找亮点并不是特别有用，但这就是为什么我将“查看亮点”链接保留在引用下方的原因。

It's been awhile, but I think Readwise's defaults assume you want highlights with annotations and tags as bullet points, outliner style. I personally prefer to use section headings and blockquotes because it feels semantically cleaner than having everything in a bullet point, but your mileage may vary, especially if you plan to embed highlights into  research articles you're writing as quotes and want the citation and citekey to be handy when you do even if it's redundant at the source file level. I am not an academic and don't have to worry about that, so at the individual level, I focus on the stuff I actually care about – the content of the quote.  
已经有一段时间了，但我认为 Readwise 的默认设置假设您想要带有注释和标签的高亮显示作为要点、大纲样式。我个人更喜欢使用章节标题和块引号，因为它在语义上比将所有内容都放在要点中感觉更清晰，但你的里程可能会有所不同，特别是如果你打算将要点嵌入到你正在撰写的研究文章中作为引号并希望引用和 citekey即使它在源文件级别是多余的，在您这样做时也很方便。我不是学者，不必担心这一点，所以在个人层面上，我专注于我真正关心的东西——引用的内容。

Or, well, realistically – some quotes. My job is to write articles, not process notes, so I don't bother to deal with every highlight I make. Inevitably, I read and highlight more articles than I have time to fully process in Obsidian. There are currently 483 files in the `Readwise/Articles` folder and 527 files marked as needing to be processed. I have, depending on how you count, between 3 and 5 jobs right now. I am not going to neatly format all of those files. I am going to focus on the important ones, when I have time.  
或者，嗯，现实地——一些引述。我的工作是写文章，不是处理笔记，所以我懒得去处理我做的每一个亮点。不可避免地，我阅读和突出显示的文章多于我有时间在 Obsidian 中完全处理。目前 `Readwise/Articles` 文件夹中有483个文件，标记为需要处理的文件有527个。根据你的计算方式，我现在有 3 到 5 个工作岗位。我不会整齐地格式化所有这些文件。当我有时间的时候，我会专注于重要的事情。

This article about Kashmiri Cheese is important to me because it's been tagged `#nonfic/addendum/cheese` which means it's a good candidate for inclusion in a follow-up article to [my newsletter about how Cheese is surprisingly gross — but useful](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/cheese/). Here's an example of a different [follow-up about cheese](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/eclectic220916/) so you can see how this kind of information ultimately gets used; I never want to be one of those [people who who write extensively about note-writing but rarely have a serious context of use](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zUMFE66dxeweppDvgbNAb5hukXzXQu8ErVNv).  
这篇关于克什米尔奶酪的文章对我很重要，因为它被标记为 `#nonfic/addendum/cheese` ，这意味着它很适合包含在我的时事通讯的后续文章中，该文章讲述了奶酪如何出奇地恶心——但很有用。这是关于奶酪的不同后续示例，因此您可以了解最终如何使用此类信息；我永远不想成为那些广泛写笔记但很少有认真使用的人中的一员。

When it comes to the actual file as it exists in my notes, though, I like to change the metadata first. It's hard for computers to figure out the difference between an "author" and a "publication," but important to me, so the first thing I do is go find out which where Safina Nabi published this article. [Atlas Obscura](https://www.atlasobscura.com/) is one of my favorite sources of random human interest stories with an anthropological, historic, and culinary bent, so it already has a page for it. I use the [Natural Language Dates plugin](https://github.com/argenos/nldates-obsidian) to translate the publication date of January 28, 2022 to 2022-01-28 for my own sense of consistency (which as we know is already pretty shaky, but eh).  
但是，当涉及到我笔记中存在的实际文件时，我喜欢先更改元数据。计算机很难区分“作者”和“出版物”之间的区别，但对我来说很重要，所以我做的第一件事就是找出 Safina Nabi 发表这篇文章的地方。 Atlas Obscura 是我最喜欢的随机人类兴趣故事来源之一，具有人类学、历史和烹饪倾向，因此它已经有一个页面。我使用 Natural Language Dates 插件将发布日期 2022 年 1 月 28 日翻译为 2022-01-28，以保持我自己的一致性（我们知道这已经很不稳定了，但是嗯）。

Next and most importantly, I review the highlights. As I read through the quotes, I make sure they still make sense, and go back to the original source and investigate them if they don't. If something still seems pointless after I reviewed it in context, I just delete it.  
接下来也是最重要的是，我回顾了亮点。当我通读引文时，我会确保它们仍然有意义，如果不合理，我会回到原始来源并进行调查。如果我在上下文中查看过某些内容后仍然觉得毫无意义，我就会将其删除。

Once I've cleaned up any awkward formatting, weird links, or broken tags, I check to make sure the annotations are as useful as they can be.  
一旦我清理了任何难看的格式、奇怪的链接或损坏的标签，我就会检查以确保注释尽可能有用。

The main thing is to try to get a sense of why I highlighted the quote - it's not always because it's something I need to take notes on! Sometimes I highlight a quote in an article because it mentions some research I need to follow up on later, or because there's something I want to share with someone, and I wasn't in a position to do so while reading it the first time. My highlights are littered with notes to self and action items - it's not all pure knowledge.  
最主要的是试着弄清楚我为什么要强调这句话——这并不总是因为这是我需要做笔记的东西！有时我会在一篇文章中突出引用，因为它提到了一些我以后需要跟进的研究，或者因为我想与某人分享一些东西，而我在第一次阅读它时无法做到这一点。我的亮点中充斥着自我笔记和行动项目——这不全是纯粹的知识。

For example, if I've left myself a note like `#pkm/xref this reminds me of something the Carthage expert I like said, but I can't remember her name` I will search my notes to figure out the name of the Carthage expert I like, cross-reference the highlight with things she said, and add links and update notes as appropriate. If I said something like `This reminds me of the article about the guy a crane is in love with` when I was taking notes on something without access to my notes, I will go find [the article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/style/wp/2018/07/23/feature/the-crane-who-fell-in-love-with-a-human/) and link to my notes about it so that my backlinks and graph are updated.  
例如，如果我给自己留了一个像 `#pkm/xref this reminds me of something the Carthage expert I like said, but I can't remember her name` 这样的笔记，我会搜索我的笔记以找出我喜欢的迦太基专家的名字，交叉引用突出显示的内容和她所说的话，并适当地添加链接和更新笔记.如果我在无法访问我的笔记的情况下做笔记时说了 `This reminds me of the article about the guy a crane is in love with` 之类的话，我会找到这篇文章并链接到我的笔记，以便我的反向链接和图表得到更新。

##### Engaging 引人入胜

As much as I give the "paraphrase everything!" people a hard time, I do think it's important to ~rephrase, summarize, process, reinterpret~ put quotes into a more useful format. The problem with "summarizing" is that most people wind up in the habit of swapping out words and phrases for synonyms, enough to avoid pinging a plagiarism meter. This isn't enough to really make the quote _useful,_ even if it does often help  you confirm you understand it.  
就像我给出的“释义一切！”人们很难过，我确实认为重要的是重新措辞、总结、处理、重新解释把引语变成更有用的格式。 “总结”的问题在于，大多数人最终都养成了将单词和短语换成同义词的习惯，这足以避免抄袭抄袭。这还不足以让引用真正有用，即使它确实经常帮助您确认您理解它。

I prefer to consider the quote _evidence for a claim,_ which necessitates using it to make a claim. Sometimes evidence can be used for multiple claims, which is great - but often means the quote should be broken out into smaller pieces.  
我更愿意考虑索赔的引用证据，这需要使用它来提出索赔。有时证据可以用于多项声明，这很好——但通常意味着引用应该被分解成更小的部分。

Let's take a look at the first highlight from this article:  
让我们来看看本文的第一个亮点：

```
### id286148681

> Zandee did not know the nomads’ language, so his friend Gulzar translated as Zandee asked how much they made from selling the cheese. “Nothing,” Gulzar said. “They just do it so that the milk will not go stale. At most, they will barter it with a shopkeeper who may give them a pound of sugar or a dozen matchsticks.”
```

The ID number is just to give me something unique to search for, since you can't target a blank header and there's no point in coming up with my own random string of  numbers for a block/header reference when Readwise already has one in its database.  
ID 号只是为了给我一些独特的搜索，因为你不能定位一个空白标题，并且当 Readwise 已经在其数据库。

This quote has a lot of context and vivid language, but my primary takeaway – the reason I highlighted  it, even though I didn't make a note at the time (because it's obvious to me and I don't like to do unnecessary work) — is that `nomads make cheese to preserve milk`, or perhaps `nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk` which is wordier but also more accurate.  
这句话有很多背景和生动的语言，但我的主要收获 - 我强调它的原因，即使我当时没有做笔记（因为这对我来说很明显而且我不喜欢做不必要的工作) — 是 `nomads make cheese to preserve milk` 还是 `nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk` 更冗长但也更准确。

Here are some other examples now that I've gone through and engaged with all of the highlights.  
下面是一些其他的例子，我已经完成并参与了所有的亮点。

Note that some of the headers are still metaphorically blank, with just the ID number; that's because some of these quotes are interesting context, but not necessarily things that I feel need to become anything more than what they are; context, or reference materials for where certain places are located. Not every highlight needs to become a "card" — and having things in my notes that are highlighted but don't need to be turned into further notes does not mean that I have failed by "over-highlighting."  
请注意，有些标题仍然隐喻为空白，只有 ID 号；那是因为其中一些引述是有趣的背景，但不一定是我认为需要变得比现在更重要的东西；某些地方所在的上下文或参考资料。并不是每一个重点都需要成为一张“卡片”——在我的笔记中有一些被突出显示但不需要变成进一步笔记的东西并不意味着我因为“过度突出”而失败了。

Useful notes are messy, and time is valuable. A sense of completionism is nice for some things but mostly just gets in the way when it comes to learning. I read about 10% of the articles that show up in my feed. I take highlight about 50% of those, and affirmatively take notes on about 10% of those. This doesn't mean I wasted my time reading, or that I failed at notetaking because I should have done a better job of taking comprehensive notes. It means I used judgment, and used my time wisely, and focused on things that were worthwhile from a return on investment perspective.  
有用的笔记乱七八糟，时间宝贵。完成主义的感觉对某些事情来说是好的，但在大多数情况下只会妨碍学习。我阅读了 Feed 中出现的大约 10% 的文章。我强调了其中的大约 50%，并肯定地记录了其中的大约 10%。这并不意味着我浪费了阅读时间，或者我记笔记失败了，因为我本应该在做全面笔记方面做得更好。这意味着我运用了判断力，明智地利用了我的时间，并专注于从投资回报的角度来看有价值的事情。

#### The Zettelizer Zettelizer

There are two primary schools of thought when it comes to the question of how best to turn long source notes with big collections of quotes and annotations into the "atomic notes" (or ["zettels," which is basically German for "note"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten)) that take fuller advantages of Obsidian's featureset than relying on headings and blocks.  
关于如何最好地将带有大量引文和注释的长源笔记转换为“原子笔记”（或“zettels”，基本上是德语的“笔记”）的问题，有两种主要的思想流派比依赖标题和块更充分地利用 Obsidian 的功能集。

Some folks like to move the entire text of the highlight out into a new note, which is named after the heading, and then embed the new note back into the literature note. The advantage of this is that when you search for a string of text, like for example "Cheese," you get a note with a useful title ("Kashmiri people make goat and sheep cheese") instead of, say, the name of a book like "Middle Eastern Culture by Joana Dhoe" which doesn't do me as much good when I'm skimming file names in the search results trying to figure out [what I have previously learned about cheese](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/cheese).  
有些人喜欢将突出显示的整个文本移出到以标题命名的新注释中，然后将新注释嵌入到文献注释中。这样做的好处是，当你搜索一串文本时，比如“奶酪”，你会得到一个带有有用标题的注释（“克什米尔人制作山羊和绵羊奶酪”），而不是，比如说，一个奶酪的名称像“Joana Dhoe 的中东文化”这样的书，当我浏览搜索结果中的文件名试图弄清楚我以前对奶酪的了解时，它对我的帮助不大。

Despite the advantages of this method, though, I prefer to leave the quotes with the source, mostly because it makes it easier for me to send a file of quotes to a friend who asks for my takeaways from a specific book, for example my major takeaways from [Oh Crap! Potty Training: Everything Modern Parents Need To Know...](https://www.amazon.com/Crap-Potty-Training-Everything-Parenting/dp/1501122983) made the rounds in my offline social group and it was a lot easier to explain to non-technical people how to open and read a plain text file than how to navigate a bunch of nodes in a not-exactly-mainstream [integrated thinking environment](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/ite-not-second-brain/).  
尽管这种方法有很多优点，但我更喜欢将引文与来源一起保留，主要是因为这样我可以更轻松地将引文文件发送给朋友，而朋友要我从某本书中摘录一些内容，例如我的专业Oh Crap 的外卖！如厕训练：现代父母需要知道的一切……在我的离线社交群组中流传开来，向非技术人员解释如何打开和阅读纯文本文件比如何导航一堆节点要容易得多在一个不完全主流的综合思维环境中。

Anyway, the method I use to turn these claims into notes is pretty straightforward:  
不管怎样，我用来将这些声明变成笔记的方法非常简单：

1.  Make a new file and give it the name of your claim (minus the ID):  `nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk`  
    创建一个新文件并为其提供您的声明名称（减去 ID）： `nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk`
2.  Embed the relevant section into your new file: `![[The Kashmiri Cheese Brand Operating at 7,000 Feet by Safina Nabi#id286148681 nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk]]`. A neat trick you can do with the IDs is copy it, then just type `[[##id286148681` - the reference will pop right up. This is one reason I like to use the IDs, since they're unique, it keeps me from having to type through all the "nomads..." options that might possibly show up, if I have a lot of notes that start similarly (more common in a long file, like book notes for a specific topic like bananas).  
    将相关部分嵌入到您的新文件中： `![[The Kashmiri Cheese Brand Operating at 7,000 Feet by Safina Nabi#id286148681 nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk]]` 。您可以使用 ID 做的一个巧妙的技巧是复制它，然后只需键入 `[[##id286148681` - 引用将立即弹出。这是我喜欢使用 ID 的原因之一，因为它们是独一无二的，如果我有很多以类似方式开始的笔记，它使我不必输入可能会出现的所有“游牧民...”选项（在长文件中更常见，例如香蕉等特定主题的书本笔记）。
3.  Move over any annotations (I indicate this with the `- [n]` [data-task bullet](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/alternative-checkboxes-icon-bullets-copy-and-paste/35962), but this isn't necessary) and add links to relevant connections if I want to. Seeing "nomads make cheese to avoid wasting milk" is more useful if I'm searching for information about `nomads` than "The Kashmiri Cheese Brand Operating at 7,000 Feet by Safina Nabi" would be, and with this method, my index file for nomads would have a bunch of claims neatly listed for me already, instead of a bunch of references I need to go re-learn from.  
    移动任何注释（我用 `- [n]` data-task bullet 表示这一点，但这不是必需的）并在需要时添加指向相关连接的链接。如果我正在搜索有关 `nomads` 的信息，看到“游牧民族制作奶酪以避免浪费牛奶”比“Safina Nabi 在 7,000 英尺高处运营的克什米尔奶酪品牌”更有用，并且使用这种方法，我的索引文件游牧民族已经为我整齐地列出了一堆声明，而不是一堆我需要重新学习的参考资料。

Since this can involve a lot of repetitive actions on a long file, I use [this javascript code](https://gist.github.com/eleanorkonik/17ee7e5178d8095b9630b812d9b3226f) along with the [QuickAdd](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd) plugin, to do it for me. I did not write this code myself Sam Morrison and Christian Bager Bach did most of the work, but in addition to the steps above, the script will also create an outline of links to the new files up in the Metadata list. Although Obsidian has an Outline plugin that lets you see your headers, I prefer to  have a nice overview of key details at the top of the file, so I can see it when I preview the file on hover if it comes up in my backlinks elsewhere.  
由于这可能涉及对长文件进行大量重复操作，因此我使用此 javascript 代码和 QuickAdd 插件来为我完成此操作。这段代码不是我自己编写的，Sam Morrison 和 Christian Bager Bach 完成了大部分工作，但除了上述步骤之外，该脚本还将创建指向元数据列表中新文件的链接大纲。虽然 Obsidian 有一个 Outline 插件可以让你看到你的标题，但我更喜欢在文件顶部有一个很好的关键细节概述，所以如果它出现在我其他地方的反向链接中，我可以在悬停预览文件时看到它.

It looks like this: 它看起来像这样：

![](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/content/images/2022/10/zettelize.gif)

The key to using the script is to change the stuff inside the quotes on line 20 `constfolder="40 Slipbox/42 Zettels";` to the path for whatever you want the destination of your notes to be.  
使用该脚本的关键是将第 20 行 `constfolder="40 Slipbox/42 Zettels";` 中引号内的内容更改为您想要的笔记目的地的路径。

The hardest part of using the script is setting up the QuickAdd macro; [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYK3VDQsZJo) from the developer has a comprehensive guide starting at 15:45, but basically you type "Zettelize" into the box by Add Choice:  
使用脚本最难的部分是设置 QuickAdd 宏；开发者的这段视频从 15:45 开始有一个全面的指南，但基本上你通过添加选择在框中输入“Zettelize”：

You can get to this screen by going into Obsidian's Settings.  
您可以通过进入 Obsidian 的设置进入此屏幕。

and follow the directions for how he uses his Kanban Script, but with [the Zettelizer script](https://gist.github.com/eleanorkonik/17ee7e5178d8095b9630b812d9b3226f) instead. You can also follow the directions for [this installation guide](https://github.com/chhoumann/quickadd/blob/master/docs/Examples/Capture_FetchTasksFromTodoist.md#installation-video), which is a bit shorter.  
并按照他如何使用看板脚本的说明进行操作，但改为使用 Zettelizer 脚本。您也可以按照本安装指南的说明进行操作，该指南更短一些。

Once I'm done running the script, I remove the `#pkm/process` tag and move the file from my `Pending` folder to my `References` folder.  
运行完脚本后，我删除了 `#pkm/process` 标记并将文件从我的 `Pending` 文件夹移动到我的 `References` 文件夹。

This is just one method of handling a Readwise/Obsidian integration, there are others that are honestly safer and more robust, like [this Obsidian Readwise Inbox via TfTHacker](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian-readwise-inbox).  
这只是处理 Readwise/Obsidian 集成的一种方法，还有其他方法确实更安全、更健壮，例如通过 TfTHacker 提供的 Obsidian Readwise Inbox。

## Manifestations: Referencing Notes For A Purpose  
表现形式：出于某种目的参考笔记

That's the last step in terms of making notes, but the real trick is in using the notes.  
这是做笔记的最后一步，但真正的诀窍在于使用笔记。

If I'm planning a vacation, I search my vault for information I've gathered about local places. Every spring, I check the previous years' reflections on mishaps and successes before planting my garden. If I'm working on a story involving a fantastical creature, I reference the notes I made about the quirks of biologically similar animals that exist in the real world.  
如果我计划去度假，我会在我的保险库中搜索我收集到的关于当地的信息。每年春天，在种植我的花园之前，我都会检查前几年对不幸和成功的反思。如果我正在写一个涉及奇幻生物的故事，我会参考我所做的关于现实世界中存在的生物学相似动物的怪癖的笔记。

This whole workflow is designed around my very specific goals. I write fantasy and science fiction. I write [newsletters sharing highlights from my research](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/), and related essays about topics like [the nature of identity in the ancient world](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/ancient-identities-complex-cultures/). I also occasionally write scifi/fantasy adjacent nonfiction pieces, [f](https://www.sfwa.org/2021/08/10/unusual-governments-to-take-inspiration-from/)or example [all the things that trees can be](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik.com/all-the-things-that-trees-can-be/): from homes & magic roads to natural air conditioners.  
整个工作流程是围绕我非常具体的目标设计的。我写奇幻小说和科幻小说。我撰写时事通讯分享我的研究重点，以及有关古代世界身份本质等主题的相关文章。我偶尔也会写科幻/幻想相邻的非小说作品，例如树木可以做的所有事情：从房屋和神奇的道路到天然空调。

As such, while pieces of my process might work for you, or at least spark some ideas, I am _not_ trying to convince anyone to use these methods to hack your way to the one true method for success as a writer or thinker or anything. We've all got our quirks, and in many ways I am weird. Not many people serialize short fiction on a personal newsletter that is mostly targeted toward history nerds, after all.  
因此，虽然我的过程中的一些部分可能对你有用，或者至少激发了一些想法，但我并不是要说服任何人使用这些方法来破解你成为作家或思想家或其他任何人的真正成功方法。我们都有自己的怪癖，而且在很多方面我都很奇怪。毕竟，没有多少人在主要针对历史书呆子的个人时事通讯上连载短篇小说。

With that caveat, if you'd like to see me _use_ notes like these in order to actually write an article, here's a livestream of me doing just that.  
有了这个警告，如果你想看到我使用这样的笔记来真正写一篇文章，这里是我这样做的直播。
