I’ve been thinking a lot about failure lately. Failure comes in many forms, but I’m especially interested in situations in which people _\*perceive\*_ something as failing (or about to fail) and the contestations over failure that often arise in such situations. Given this, it’s hard not to be fascinated by all that’s unfolding around Twitter. At this point in the story of Musk’s takeover, there’s a spectrum of perspectives about Twitter’s pending doom (or lack thereof). But there’s more to failure than the binary question of “will Twitter fail or won’t it?” Here’s some thoughts on how I’m thinking about the failure question…  
我最近一直在思考失败。失败有多种形式，但我对人们 \* 认为 \* 某事失败（或即将失败）的情况以及在这种情况下经常出现的失败争论特别感兴趣。鉴于此，很难不被围绕 Twitter 展开的一切所吸引。在马斯克接管故事的这一点上，对于 Twitter 即将面临的厄运（或没有厄运）存在多种观点。但除了 “Twitter 会失败还是不会失败？” 这个二元问题之外，还有更多的失败。以下是关于我如何思考失败问题的一些想法……

## 1\. Failure of social media sites tends to be slow then fast.  
1\. 社交媒体网站的失败往往先慢后快。

I spent a ridiculous amount of time in the aughts trying to understand the rise and fall of social network sites like Friendster and MySpace. I noticed something fascinating. If a central node in a network disappeared and went somewhere else (like from MySpace to Facebook), that person could pull some portion of their connections with them to a new site. However, if the accounts on the site that drew emotional intensity stopped doing so, people stopped engaging as much. Watching Friendster come undone, I started to think that the fading of emotionally sticky nodes was even more problematic than the disappearance of segments of the graph.  
我花了很多荒谬的时间试图了解 Friendster 和 MySpace 等社交网站的兴衰。我注意到了一些有趣的事情。如果网络中的一个中心节点消失了并去了其他地方（比如从 MySpace 到 Facebook），那个人可以将他们与他们的部分联系拉到一个新站点。然而，如果网站上引起情绪紧张的账户停止这样做，人们就会停止参与。看着 Friendster 失败，我开始认为情感粘性节点的消退比图表部分的消失更成问题。

With MySpace, I was trying to identify the point where I thought the site was going to unravel. When I started seeing the disappearance of emotionally sticky nodes, I reached out to members of the MySpace team to share my concerns and they told me that their numbers looked fine. Active uniques were high, the amount of time people spent on the site was continuing to grow, and new accounts were being created at a rate faster than accounts were being closed. I shook my head; I didn’t think that was enough. A few months later, the site started to unravel.  
对于 MySpace，我试图找出我认为该网站将崩溃的点。当我开始看到情绪粘性节点消失时，我联系了 MySpace 团队的成员分享我的担忧，他们告诉我他们的数字看起来不错。活跃的唯一用户数很高，人们在网站上花费的时间持续增长，新帐户的创建速度快于帐户关闭的速度。我摇摇头；我认为这还不够。几个月后，该网站开始瓦解。

On a different project, I was talking with a cis/hetero dating site that was struggling with fraud. Many of its “fake” accounts were purportedly “women” but they were really a scam to entice people into paying for a porn site. But when the site started removing these profiles, they found that the site as a whole was unraveling. Men didn’t like these fake women, but their profiles enticed them to return. Moreover, attractive women saw these profiles and felt like it was a site full of people more attractive than them so they came. When the fake women disappeared, the real women disappeared. And so did the men.  
在另一个项目中，我正在与一个正在与欺诈作斗争的顺式 / 异性交友网站交谈。它的许多 “假” 帐户据称是“女性”，但它们实际上是诱使人们为色情网站付费的骗局。但当网站开始删除这些配置文件时，他们发现整个网站都在崩溃。男人不喜欢这些假女人，但她们的个人资料诱使他们返回。此外，有魅力的女性看到这些个人资料，觉得这是一个充满比她们更有魅力的人的网站，所以她们来了。当假女人消失时，真女人也消失了。男人们也是如此。

Network effects intersect with perception to drive a sense of a site’s social relevance and interpersonal significance.  
网络效应与感知相交，以推动对网站的社会相关性和人际意义的感知。

I don’t have access to the Twitter social graph these days, but I’d bet my bottom dollar that it would indicate whether or not the site was on a trajectory towards collapse. We are certainly seeing entire sub-networks flock to Mastodon, but that’s not as meaningful as people might think because of the scale and complexity of the network graph. You can lose whole segments and not lose a site. However, if those departing are creating Swiss cheese into the network graph, then I would worry.  
这些天我无法访问 Twitter 社交图谱，但我敢打赌它会表明该网站是否正处于崩溃的轨道上。我们当然看到整个子网络涌向 Mastodon，但由于网络图的规模和复杂性，这并不像人们想象的那么有意义。您可以丢失整个细分市场，但不会丢失网站。但是，如果那些离开的人正在将瑞士奶酪放入网络图中，那么我会担心。

The bigger question concerns those emotionally sticky nodes. What constitutes a “can’t be missed” account or post varies. What draws someone to a service like Twitter varies. For some, it is the libidinal joy of seeing friends and community, the posts that provide light touch pleasure and joy. For others, it’s a masochistic desire for seeing content that raises one’s blood pressure. Still others can’t resist the drama of a train wreck.  
更大的问题涉及那些情绪粘性节点。什么构成 “不能错过” 的帐户或帖子各不相同。吸引人们使用像 Twitter 这样的服务的因素各不相同。对于一些人来说，这是看到朋友和社区的性欲快乐，提供轻触愉悦和快乐的帖子。对于其他人来说，看到升高血压的内容是一种自虐欲望。还有一些人无法抗拒火车失事的戏剧性。

The funny thing about Twitter’s feed algorithms is that they were designed to amplify the content that triggered the most reaction, those emotionally sticky posts. This is why boring but informative content never has a chance against that which prompts fury. But it also means that we’re all watching how our little universe of content is changing (or not). Are you still seeing the things that give you pleasure? Or just the stuff that makes you angry? Why can’t you resist looking away from the things that give you pain? (That question isn’t a new one… it’s the question that underlies our toxic social media ecology more generally.)  
Twitter 的提要算法的有趣之处在于，它们旨在放大引发最多反应的内容，即那些情绪化的帖子。这就是为什么无聊但内容丰富的内容永远无法与激怒的内容相提并论。但这也意味着我们都在关注我们的小内容世界如何变化（或不变）。你还在看那些让你快乐的东西吗？或者只是让你生气的东西？为什么你忍不住把目光从给你带来痛苦的事情上移开？ （这个问题不是一个新问题…… 这个问题更普遍地构成了我们有毒的社交媒体生态的基础。）

I have to give Musk and gang some credit for knowing that drama brings traffic. The drama that unfolds in the World Cup is wholesome compared to the drama of watching public acts of humiliation, cruelty, and hate. We’re in a modern day Coliseum watching a theater of suffering performed for the king under the rubric of “justice.” And just like the ancient Romans, we can’t look away.  
我必须赞扬马斯克和他的帮派，因为他们知道戏剧会带来流量。与观看公开的羞辱、残忍和仇恨行为的戏剧相比，世界杯上演的戏剧是有益健康的。我们在现代的体育馆里观看以 “正义” 为名为国王表演的苦难剧场。就像古罗马人一样，我们无法将视线移开。

But how long can the spectacle last? Even the Roman Empire eventually collapsed, but perhaps the theater of the absurd can persist for a while. Still, there are other factors to consider.  
但奇观能持续多久？即便是罗马帝国最终也崩溃了，但荒诞剧场或许还能坚持一段时间。不过，还有其他因素需要考虑。

## 2\. Failure can be nothing more than a normal accident that tears down the infrastructure.  
2\. 失败只不过是破坏基础设施的正常事故。

Nearly everyone I talk with is surprised that the actual service of Twitter is mostly still working. What that says to me is that the engineering team was far more solid than I appreciated. Any engineering team worth its salt is going to build redundancy and resilience into the system. Exceptions that are thrown should be caught and managed. But that doesn’t mean that a system can persist indefinitely without [maintenance and repair](https://themaintainers.org/).  
几乎所有与我交谈过的人都对 Twitter 的实际服务大部分仍在运行感到惊讶。这对我来说是，工程团队比我欣赏的要扎实得多。任何称职的工程团队都会在系统中构建冗余和弹性。抛出的异常应该被捕获和管理。但这并不意味着一个系统可以在没有维护和修理的情况下无限期地存在。

Think of it in terms of a house. If you walk away from your home for a while, the pipes will probably keep working fine on their own. Until a big freeze comes. And then, if no one is looking, they’ll burst, flood the house, and trigger failure after failure. The reason for doing maintenance is to minimize the likelihood of this event. And the reason to have contingencies built in is to prevent a problem from rippling across the system.  
把它想象成一所房子。如果您离开家一段时间，管道可能会自行正常工作。直到大冻结到来。然后，如果没有人注意，它们就会爆裂，淹没房子，并引发一次又一次的失败。进行维护的原因是为了尽量减少发生此事件的可能性。内置意外事件的原因是为了防止问题波及整个系统。

What happens when Twitter’s code needs to be tweaked to manage an iOS upgrade? Or if a library dependency goes poof? What happens when a security vulnerability isn’t patched?  
当 Twitter 的代码需要调整以管理 iOS 升级时会发生什么？或者，如果库依赖性变得糟糕？安全漏洞未修补时会发生什么？

One interesting concept in organizational sociology is “normal accidents theory.” [Studying Three Mile Island](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691004129/normal-accidents), Charles Perrow created a 2x2 grid before b-schools everywhere made this passé.  
组织社会学中一个有趣的概念是 “正常事故理论”。在研究三哩岛时，Charles Perrow 创建了一个 2x2 的网格，然后各地的商学院都让这个网格过时了。

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/1160/0*9q4Ci9bmv7DNTclL)

One axis represented the complexity of interactions in a system; the other axis reflected the “coupling” of a system. A loosely coupled system has little dependencies, but a tightly coupled system has components that are highly dependent on others. Perrow argued that “normal accidents” were nearly inevitable in a complex, tightly coupled system. To resist such an outcome, systems designers needed to have backups and redundancy, safety checks and maintenance. In the language of computers, resilience requires having available “buffer” to manage any overflow.  
一个轴表示系统中交互的复杂性；另一个轴反映了系统的 “耦合”。松散耦合的系统几乎没有依赖性，但紧耦合的系统具有高度依赖于其他组件的组件。佩罗认为，在一个复杂、紧密耦合的系统中，“正常事故” 几乎是不可避免的。为了抵制这种结果，系统设计人员需要进行备份和冗余、安全检查和维护。在计算机语言中，弹性需要有可用的 “缓冲区” 来管理任何溢出。

Having dozens of engineers working around the clock to respond to crises can temporarily prevent failure. But those engineers will get tired, mistakes will happen, and maintenance will get kicked down the road. Teams need buffer as much as systems do.  
让数十名工程师全天候工作以应对危机可以暂时避免故障。但是那些工程师会感到疲倦，会发生错误，并且维护工作会被踢到路上。团队和系统一样需要缓冲。

I’m concerned about the state of the team at Twitter, not just because so many people were laid off. If my hunch is right, many of the engineers who are keeping Twitter going fall into four groups. There are immigrants on H1Bs who are effectively indentured servants, many of whom would leave if they could, but the industry is falling apart which makes departures unlikely. There are also apolitical engineers who need a job and there are few jobs to be found in the industry right now. Neither of these groups will want to drive themselves to the bone in the long term. Then there are Musk fanboys who want to ride this rollercoaster for whatever personal motivation. And there are goons on loan from other public companies that Musk owns. (Side note: how how how is it legal for Musk to use employees from public companies for his private project!?!? Is this something that the Delaware courts are going to influence?)  
我担心 Twitter 团队的状况，不仅仅是因为有那么多人被解雇了。如果我的直觉是正确的，许多保持 Twitter 运行的工程师可以分为四类。 H1B 上的移民实际上是契约仆人，如果可以的话，他们中的许多人会离开，但该行业正在分崩离析，这使得离开的可能性很小。还有一些不关心政治的工程师需要一份工作，而现在这个行业几乎找不到工作。从长远来看，这两个群体都不想把自己逼到骨子里。还有一些马斯克的狂热爱好者，他们出于任何个人动机都想坐上过山车。还有从马斯克拥有的其他上市公司借来的暴徒。 （旁注：马斯克利用上市公司的员工进行他的私人项目是怎么合法的！？！？这是特拉华州法院要影响的事情吗？）

[Fail Whale, an internet icon  
失败的鲸鱼，一个互联网图标](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/01/the-story-behind-twitters-fail-whale/384313/)

In the early days of Twitter, moments of failure were celebrated with a Fail Whale, the iconic image that Twitter posted when something went terribly awry in the system, requiring it to be shut down and, effectively, rebooted. It’s been a long time since we saw the Fail Whale because there was a strong infrastructure team who worked to bake resilience into the system. In other words, Twitter grew up.  
在 Twitter 的早期，失败的时刻是用失败的鲸鱼来庆祝的，这是 Twitter 在系统出现严重错误时发布的标志性图像，需要将其关闭并有效地重新启动。我们已经很久没有看到失败的鲸鱼了，因为有一个强大的基础架构团队致力于将弹性融入系统。换句话说，推特长大了。

How long can the resilience of the system allow it to keep functioning? It could be quite a while. But I also can’t help but think of a video I saw years ago about what would happen to New York City if the humans suddenly disappeared overnight. First the pipes burst and the rats invaded. But without humans leaving behind trash, the rats eventually died. The critters that remained? The cockroaches of course.  
系统的弹性可以让它保持运行多长时间？可能需要相当长的时间。但我也忍不住想起多年前看过的一段视频，内容是如果人类在一夜之间突然消失，纽约市会发生什么。首先是水管爆裂，老鼠入侵。但是没有人类留下垃圾，老鼠最终死了。剩下的小动物？当然是蟑螂。

## 3\. Failure is entangled with perception.  
3\. 失败与感知纠缠在一起。

If you searched for “miserable failure” (or even just “failure”) on September 29, 2006, the first result was the official George W. Bush biography. This act of [“Google bombing”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_bombing) made the internet lol. But it also hinted at a broader dynamic related to failure. There are failures that everyone can agree are failures (e.g. the explosion of the Challenger), but most failures are a matter of perception.  
如果你在 2006 年 9 月 29 日搜索 “悲惨的失败”（甚至只是“失败”），第一个结果是乔治 ·W· 布什的官方传记。这种“谷歌轰炸” 行为让互联网大笑。但它也暗示了与失败相关的更广泛的动态。有些失败是每个人都同意的失败（例如挑战者号的爆炸），但大多数失败是一种感知问题。

Politicians, policies, companies, and products are often deemed a “failure” rhetorically by those who oppose them, regardless of any empirical measure one might use. George W. Bush was deemed a failure by those who were opposed to his “War on Terrorism.” Declaring something a failure is a way to delegitimize it. And when something is delegitimized, it can become a failure.  
政客、政策、公司和产品通常被反对者口头上视为 “失败”，无论人们可能使用何种实证衡量标准。乔治 ·W· 布什 (George W. Bush) 被那些反对他的“反恐战争” 的人视为失败。宣布某事失败是使其失去合法性的一种方式。当某件事被非法化时，它可能会失败。

I often think back to MySpace’s downfall. In 2007, I [penned a controversial blog post](http://www.danah.org/papers/essays/ClassDivisions.html) noting a division that was forming as teenagers self-segregated based on race and class in the US, splitting themselves between Facebook and MySpace. A few years later, [I noted the role of the news media in this division](http://www.danah.org/papers/2011/WhiteFlight.pdf), highlighting how media coverage about MySpace as scary, dangerous, and full of pedophiles (regardless of empirical evidence) helped make this division possible. The news media played a role in delegitimizing MySpace (aided and abetted by a team at Facebook, which was directly benefiting from this delegitimization work).  
我经常回想起 MySpace 的垮台。 2007 年，我写了一篇有争议的博客文章，指出随着美国青少年根据种族和阶级自我隔离而形成的分裂，他们在 Facebook 和 MySpace 之间分裂。几年后，我注意到新闻媒体在这个部门中的作用，强调媒体关于 MySpace 的报道是可怕的、危险的和充满恋童癖者（不管经验证据如何）如何帮助使这个部门成为可能。新闻媒体在取消 MySpace 的合法性方面发挥了作用（在 Facebook 的一个团队的帮助和教唆下，该团队直接从这项取消合法化的工作中受益）。

Perception (including racism and classism) have shaped the social media landscape since the beginning.  
观念（包括种族主义和阶级主义）从一开始就塑造了社交媒体的格局。

A lot has changed about our news media ecosystem since 2007. In the United States, it’s hard to overstate how the media is entangled with contemporary partisan politics and ideology. This means that information tends not to flow across partisan divides in coherent ways that enable debate. In general, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the left declare conservative politicians/policies to be failures, this has little impact on the right because it is actively ignored by the media outlets consumed by those on the right. But interestingly, when journalists/advocates/regular people on the right declare progressive politicians/policies to be failures, both mainstream media and the left obsessively amplify falsehoods and offensive content in an attempt to critique and counteract them. (Has anyone on the left managed to avoid hearing about the latest round of celebrity anti-Semitism?)  
自 2007 年以来，我们的新闻媒体生态系统发生了很大变化。在美国，媒体如何与当代党派政治和意识形态纠缠在一起怎么强调都不为过。这意味着信息往往不会以导致辩论的连贯方式跨越党派分歧。总的来说，当左派的记者 / 拥护者 / 普通人宣布保守派政治家 / 政策失败时，这对右派影响不大，因为它被右派消费的媒体积极忽视。但有趣的是，当右翼的记者 / 拥护者 / 普通人宣布进步的政治家 / 政策失败时，主流媒体和左派都会痴迷地放大谎言和冒犯性的内容，试图批评和抵制他们。 （左边有没有人设法避免听到最新一轮的名人反犹太主义？）

I’m especially fascinated by how the things that are widely deemed failures are deemed failures for different reasons across the political spectrum. Consider the withdrawal in Afghanistan. The right did a fantastic job of rhetorically spinning this as a Biden failure, while the left criticized aspects of the mission. This shared perception of failure landed in the collective public consciousness; there was no need to debate _why_ individual groups saw it as failure. Of course, this also meant that there was no shared understanding of what led to that point, no discussion of what should’ve been done other than it should’ve been done better. Perceptions of failure don’t always lead to shared ideas of how to learn from these lessons.  
我特别着迷的是，那些被广泛认为是失败的事情是如何因为不同政治领域的不同原因而被认为是失败的。考虑从阿富汗撤军。右翼在修辞上将此作为拜登的失败做了出色的工作，而左翼则批评了任务的各个方面。这种对失败的共同看法进入了集体公众意识；没有必要争论为什么个别团体认为这是失败的。当然，这也意味着对于导致这一点的原因没有达成共识，除了应该做得更好之外没有讨论应该做什么。对失败的看法并不总是会导致关于如何从这些教训中吸取教训的共同想法。

The partisan and geopolitical dimensions of perception related to Twitter are gobsmacking. Twitter has long struggled to curb hate, racism, anti-Semitism, transphobia, and harassment. For a long time, those on the right have labeled these efforts censorship. Under the false flag of freedom of speech, the new Twitter has eradicated most safeguards, welcoming in a new era of amplified horrors, with the news media happily covering this spectacle. (This is what led Joan Donovan and I to talk about the importance of [_strategic_ silence](https://doi.org/10.1177/0002764219878229).)  
与 Twitter 相关的党派和地缘政治维度的看法令人目瞪口呆。 Twitter 长期以来一直在努力遏制仇恨、种族主义、反犹太主义、跨性别恐惧症和骚扰。长期以来，右翼人士将这些努力称为审查。在言论自由的虚假旗帜下，新推特取消了大部分保障措施，迎来了一个恐怖被放大的新时代，新闻媒体乐于报道这一景象。 （这就是让琼 · 多诺万和我谈论战略沉默的重要性的原因。）

Musk appears to be betting that the spectacle is worth it. He’s probably correct in thinking that large swaths of the world will not deem his leadership a failure either because they are ideologically aligned with him or they simply don’t care and aren’t seeing any changes to their corner of the Twitterverse.  
马斯克似乎在打赌这场奇观是值得的。他认为世界上大部分人不会认为他的领导是失败的，这可能是正确的，因为他们在意识形态上与他保持一致，或者他们根本不关心并且没有看到他们的 Twitterverse 角落有任何变化。

He also appears to believe that the advertising community will eventually relent because they always seem to do so when an audience is lingering around. And with a self-fashioned Gladiator torturing his enemies for sport in front of a live audience, there are lots of dollars on the table. Musk appears convinced that capitalistic interests will win out.  
他似乎还相信广告界最终会松懈，因为当观众徘徊时，他们似乎总是这样做。一个自我塑造的角斗士在现场观众面前折磨他的敌人以进行体育运动，桌面上有很多美元。马斯克似乎坚信资本主义利益会胜出。

So the big question in my mind is: how effective will the perception that Twitter is failing be in the long run, given how it is not jumping across existing ideological divisions? Perception of failure _can_ bring about failure, but it doesn’t always. That’s the story of many brands who resist public attacks. Perception of failure can also just fade into the background, reifying existing divisions.  
因此，我心中的一个大问题是：鉴于 Twitter 无法跨越现有的意识形态分歧，从长远来看，认为 Twitter 失败的看法会有多有效？对失败的认知会导致失败，但并非总是如此。这就是许多抵制公众攻击的品牌的故事。对失败的看法也可能只是淡出背景，具体化现有的分歧。

Of course, a company needs money and the only revenue stream Twitter has stems from advertising. This is one of the reasons that activism around the advertisers matters. If advocates can convince advertisers to hold out, that will starve a precarious system. That is a tangible way to leverage perception of failure. Same can be said if advocates manage to convince Apple or Google to de-list. Or if perception can be leveraged into court fights, Congressional battles, or broader policy sanctions. But right now, it seems as though perception has gotten caught in the left/right cultural war that is unfolding in the United States.  
当然，一家公司需要钱，而 Twitter 唯一的收入来源来自广告。这是围绕广告商的激进主义很重要的原因之一。如果拥护者能够说服广告商坚持下去，那将使一个不稳定的系统挨饿。这是利用对失败的看法的切实方法。如果拥护者设法说服苹果或谷歌将其除名，也可以这样说。或者，如果可以将感知用于法庭斗争、国会斗争或更广泛的政策制裁。但现在，似乎感觉已经陷入了正在美国展开的左 / 右文化战争。

## 4\. Failure is an end state.  
4\. 失败是一种终结状态。

There are many ways in which the Twitter story _could_ end, but it’s important to remember that most companies _do_ eventually end (or become unrecognizable after 100+ years). The internet is littered with failed companies. And even though companies like Yahoo! still have a website, they are in a “permanently failing” status. Most companies fail when they run out of money. And the financials around Twitter are absurd. As a company, it has persisted almost entirely on a single profit stream: advertising. That business strategy requires eyeballs. As we’ve already witnessed, a subscription plan for salvation is a joke.  
Twitter 故事的结局有多种方式，但重要的是要记住，大多数公司最终都会结束（或者在 100 多年后变得面目全非）。互联网上到处都是失败的公司。即使像雅虎这样的公司！仍然有一个网站，他们处于 “永久失败” 状态。大多数公司在资金用完时都会倒闭。 Twitter 的财务状况很荒谬。作为一家公司，它几乎完全依靠单一的利润来源：广告。该业务战略需要眼球。正如我们已经看到的那样，救赎订阅计划是一个笑话。

The debt financing around Twitter is gob-smacking. I cannot for the life of me understand what the creditors were thinking, but the game of finance is a next level sport where destroying people, companies, and products to achieve victory is widely tolerated. Historical trends suggest that the losers in this chaos will not be Musk or the banks, but the public.  
围绕 Twitter 的债务融资令人震惊。我这辈子都无法理解债权人的想法，但金融游戏是一种更高级的运动，人们广泛容忍通过摧毁人、公司和产品来取得胜利。历史趋势表明，这场混乱中的输家不会是马斯克或银行，而是公众。

For an anchor point, consider the collapse of local news journalism. The myth that this was caused by craigslist or Google drives me bonkers. Throughout the 80s and 90s, private equity firms and hedge funds gobbled up local news enterprises to extract their real estate. They didn’t give a shit about journalism; they just wanted prime real estate that they could develop. And news organizations had it in the form of buildings in the middle of town. So financiers squeezed the news orgs until there was no money to be squeezed and then they hung them out to dry. There was no configuration in which local news was going to survive, no magical upwards trajectory of revenue based on advertising alone. If it weren’t for craigslist and Google, the financiers would’ve squeezed these enterprises for a few more years, but the end state was always failure. Failure was the profit strategy for the financiers. (It still boggles my mind how many people believe that the loss of news journalism is because of internet advertising. I have to give financiers credit for their tremendous skill at shifting the blame.)  
对于锚点，请考虑当地新闻业的崩溃。这是由 craigslist 或谷歌引起的神话让我疯狂。在整个 80 和 90 年代，私募股权公司和对冲基金吞并了当地的新闻企业以榨取他们的房地产。他们根本不在乎新闻业；他们只是想要他们可以开发的优质房地产。新闻机构以市中心建筑物的形式拥有它。所以金融家们压榨新闻机构，直到压榨不出钱，然后他们就把它们挂起来晾干。没有地方新闻可以生存的配置，也没有仅基于广告的神奇收入增长轨迹。如果不是 craigslist 和谷歌，金融家们会再压榨这些企业几年，但最终的结果总是失败。失败是金融家的盈利策略。 （我仍然感到困惑，有多少人认为新闻业的衰落是因为互联网广告。我不得不称赞金融家们在推卸责任方面的高超技巧。）

I highly doubt that Twitter is going to be a 100-year company. For better or worse, I think failure is the end state for Twitter. The question is not _if_ but _when, how, and who will be hurt in the process?_  
我非常怀疑 Twitter 会成为一家拥有 100 年历史的公司。无论好坏，我认为失败是 Twitter 的最终状态。问题不在于是否，而是何时、如何以及谁会在此过程中受到伤害？

Right now, what worries me are the people getting hurt. I’m sickened to watch “journalists” aid and abet efforts to publicly shame former workers (especially junior employees) in a sadistic game of “accountability” that truly perverts the concept. I’m terrified for the activists and vulnerable people around the world whose content exists in Twitter’s databases, whose private tweets and DMs can be used against them if they land in the wrong hands (either by direct action or hacked activity). I’m disgusted to think that this data will almost certainly be auctioned off.  
现在，让我担心的是人们受伤了。我厌恶看到 “记者” 帮助和教唆在一场真正扭曲概念的虐待狂游戏中公开羞辱前员工（尤其是初级员工）。我为世界各地的活动家和弱势群体感到恐惧，他们的内容存在于 Twitter 的数据库中，如果他们的私人推文和 DM 落入坏人之手（通过直接行动或被黑活动），他们的私人推文和 DM 可能会被用来对付他们。一想到这些数据几乎肯定会被拍卖，我就很反感。

Frankly, there’s a part of me that keeps wondering if there’s a way to end this circus faster to prevent even greater harms. (Dear Delaware courts, any advice?)  
坦率地说，我内心的一部分一直在想，是否有办法更快地结束这个马戏团，以防止更大的伤害。 （亲爱的特拉华州法院，有什么建议吗？）

No one who creates a product wants to envision failure as an inevitable end state. Then again, humans aren’t so good at remembering that death is an inevitable end state either. But when someone doesn’t estate plan, their dependents are left with a mess. Too many of us have watched the devastating effects of dementia and, still, few of us plan for all that can go wrong when our minds fall apart and we lash out at the ones we love. Few companies die a graceful death either. And sadly, that’s what I expect we’re about to see. A manic, demented creature hurting everyone who loved it on its way out the door.  
没有一个创造产品的人愿意将失败设想为不可避免的最终状态。话又说回来，人类也不善于记住死亡是不可避免的最终状态。但是，当有人没有进行遗产规划时，他们的家属就会一团糟。我们中有太多人目睹了痴呆症的毁灭性影响，但仍然很少有人为当我们的思想崩溃并猛烈抨击我们所爱的人时可能出现的所有问题做好准备。也很少有公司能优雅地死去。可悲的是，这就是我希望我们即将看到的。一个狂躁、疯狂的生物在出门的路上伤害了所有爱它的人。

## Closing Thoughts 结束语

I’m not omniscient. I don’t know where this story ends. But after spending the last few years obsessing over what constitutes failure, I can’t help but watch this situation with a rock in my stomach.  
我不是无所不知的。我不知道这个故事在哪里结束。但是在过去的几年里一直在思考什么是失败之后，我不禁怀着一颗石头看着这种情况。

Failure isn’t a state, but a process. It can be a generative process. After all, some plants only grow after a forest fire. (And yes, yes, tech is currently obsessed with “fail fast.” But frankly, that’s more about a status game than actually _learning_.)  
失败不是一种状态，而是一个过程。它可以是一个生成过程。毕竟，有些植物只有在森林大火后才能生长。 （是的，是的，技术目前痴迷于 “快速失败”。但坦率地说，这更像是一种地位游戏，而不是真正的学习。）

Failure should not always be the end _goal_. There’s much to be said about the journey, about living a worthy life, about growing and learning and being whole. Yet, what keeps institutions, systems, companies, and products whole stems from how they are configured within a network of people, practices, and perception. Radical shifts in norms, values, and commitments can rearrange how these networks are configured. This is why transitions are hard and require a well-thought through strategy to prevent failure, especially if the goal is to be whole ethically.  
失败不应该总是最终目标。关于这段旅程，关于过有价值的生活，关于成长、学习和完整，还有很多话要说。然而，使机构、系统、公司和产品保持完整的原因在于它们在人员、实践和感知网络中的配置方式。规范、价值观和承诺的根本转变可以重新安排这些网络的配置方式。这就是为什么过渡是艰难的，并且需要通过战略进行深思熟虑以防止失败的原因，特别是如果目标是在道德上是完整的。

Watching this situation unfold, a little voice keeps nagging in my head. How should our interpretation of this situation shift if we come to believe that failure is the desired end goal? There’s a big difference between a natural forest fire and one that stems from the toxic mixture of arson and climate change.  
看着这一幕的发展，一个小小的声音不断在我脑海中萦绕。如果我们开始相信失败是预期的最终目标，我们对这种情况的解释应该如何转变？自然森林火灾与由纵火和气候变化的有毒混合物引起的火灾之间存在很大差异。
